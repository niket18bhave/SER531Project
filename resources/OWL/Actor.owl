        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Fred Astaire was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Johanna (Geilus) and Fritz Austerlitz, a brewer. Fred entered show business at age 5. He was successful both in vaudeville and on Broadway in partnership with his sister, Adele Astaire. After Adele retired to marry in 1932, Astaire headed to Hollywood. Signed to RKO, he was loaned to MGM to appear in La danza di Venere (1933) before starting work on RKO&apos;s Carioca (1933). In the latter film, he began his highly successful partnership with Ginger Rogers, with whom he danced in 9 RKO pictures. During these years, he was also active in recording and radio. On film, Astaire later appeared opposite a number of partners through various studios. After a temporary retirement in 1945-7, during which he opened Fred Astaire Dance Studios, Astaire returned to film to star in more musicals through 1957. He subsequently performed a number of straight dramatic roles in film and TV.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Lauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske on September 16, 1924, in New York City. She was the daughter of Natalie Weinstein-Bacal, a Romanian Jewish immigrant, and William Perske, who was born in New Jersey, to Polish Jewish parents. Her family was middle-class, with her father working as a salesman and her mother as a secretary. They divorced when she was five and she rarely saw her father after that.As a school girl, she originally wanted to be a dancer, but later switched gears to head into acting. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, after attending She was educated at Highland Manor, a private boarding school in Tarrytown, New York (through the generosity of wealthy uncles), and then at Julia Richman High School, which enabled her to get her feet wet in some off-Broadway productions.Out of school, she entered modeling and, because of her beauty, appeared on the cover of Harper&apos;s Bazaar, one of the most popular magazines in the US. The wife of famed director Howard Hawks spotted the picture in the publication and arranged with her husband to have Lauren take a screen test. As a result, which was entirely positive, she was given the part of Marie Browning in Acque del Sud (1944), a thriller opposite Humphrey Bogart, when she was just 19 years old. This not only set the tone for a fabulous career but also one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest love stories (she married Bogart in 1945). It was also the first of several Bogie-Bacall films.After 1945&apos;s L&apos;agente confidenziale (1945), Lauren received second billing in Il grande sonno (1946) with Bogart. The mystery, in the role of Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, was a resounding success. Although she was making one film a year, each production would be eagerly awaited by the public. In 1947, again with her husband, Lauren starred in the thriller La fuga (1947). The film kept movie patrons on the edge of their seats. The following year, she starred with Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore in L&apos;isola di corallo (1948). The crime drama was even more of a nail biter than her previous film.In 1950, Lauren starred in Le foglie d&apos;oro (1950), a drama set in 1894. It was a film of note because she appeared without her husband - her co-star was Gary Cooper. In 1953, Lauren appeared in her first comedy as Schatze Page in Come sposare un milionario (1953). The film, with co-stars Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was a smash hit all across the theaters of America.After filming La donna del destino (1957), which was released in 1957, Humphrey Bogart died on January 14 from throat cancer. Devastated at being a widow, Lauren returned to the silver screen with Dono d&apos;amore (1958) in 1958 opposite Robert Stack. The production turned out to be a big disappointment. Undaunted, Lauren moved back to New York City and appeared in several Broadway plays to huge critical acclaim. She was enjoying acting before live audiences and the audiences in turn enjoyed her fine performances.Lauren was away from the big screen for five years, but she returned in 1964 to appear in Elettroshock (1964) and Donne v&apos;insegno come si seduce un uomo (1964). The latter film was a comedy starring Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis. In 1966, Lauren starred in Detective&apos;s Story (1966) with Paul Newman and Julie Harris, which was one of former&apos;s signature films.Alternating her time between films and the stage, Lauren returned in 1974&apos;s Assassinio sull&apos;Orient Express (1974). The film, based on Agatha Christie&apos;s best-selling book was a huge hit. It also garnered Ingrid Bergman her third Oscar. Actually, the huge star-studded cast helped to ensure its success. Two years later, in 1976, Lauren co-starred with John Wayne in Il pistolero (1976). The film was Wayne&apos;s last - he died from cancer in 1979.In 1981, she played an actress being stalked by a crazed admirer in Un&apos;ombra nel buio (1981). The thriller was absolutely fascinating with Lauren in the lead role. After that production, Lauren was away from films again, this time for seven years. In the interim, she again appeared on the stages of Broadway. When she returned, it was for the filming of 1988&apos;s Mr. North (1988). After 1990&apos;s Misery non deve morire (1990) and several made for television films, Lauren appeared in 1996&apos;s Fuga dalla Casa Bianca (1996), a comedy romp with Jack Lemmon and James Garner as two ex-presidents and their escapades.Despite her age and failing health, she made a small-scale comeback in the English-language dub of Hayao Miyazaki&apos;s Il castello errante di Howl (2004) (&quot;Howl&apos;s Moving Castle,&quot; based on the young-adult novel by Diana Wynne Jones) as the Witch of the Waste, but acting endeavors for the beloved actress became increasingly rare. Lauren Bacall died on 12 August 2014, five weeks short of her 90th birthday.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Brigitte Bardot was born on September 28, 1934 in Paris, France. Her father had an engineering degree and worked with his father in the family business. Brigitte&apos;s mother encouraged her daughter to take up music and dance, and she proved to be very adept at it. By the time she was 15, Brigitte was trying a modeling career, and found herself in the French magazine &quot;Elle&quot;. Her incredible beauty readily apparent, Brigitte next tried films. In 1952, she appeared on screen for the first time as Javotte Lemoine in Le trou normand (1952). Two more films followed and it was also the same year she married Roger Vadim (the union lasted 3Â½ years). Capitalizing on her success in French films, Brigitte made her first American production in Atto d&apos;amore (1953) with Kirk Douglas, but she continued to make films in France. Brigitte&apos;s explosive sexuality took the United States by storm, and the effect she had on millions of American men who had not seen a woman like her in a long, long time--if ever--was electric. Rise to the phrase &quot;sex kitten&quot; and fascination of her in the United States consisted of magazines photographs and dubbed over French films--good, bad or indifferent, her films drew audiences--mainly men--into theaters like lemmings. In 1965, she appeared as herself in the American-made Erasmo il lentigginoso (1965) with James Stewart (she only appeared in one scene). Just before she turned 40, Brigitte retired from movies after filming Colinot l&apos;alzasottane (1973). She prefers life outside of stardom. While it enabled her to become internationally famous, it also carried with it annoyances. It was not anything for her to have &quot;fans&quot; enter her house or wander around the grounds of her home in the hopes of getting a glimpse of her or to take something that belonged to her. Paparazzi constantly hounded her with their cameras. She has been so soft-hearted that some people even have taken advantage of her generosity. After her life in the spotlight, Brigitte went on to become a leading spokesperson for animal rights and started the &quot;Foundation Brigitte Bardot&quot; dedicated solely to that cause. Her work in that realm is, perhaps, far greater than any film she could have made. Brigitte has been married to Bernard d&apos;Ormale since 1992 and they reside in St. Tropez with their nearly 50 pets.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Belushi was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA, on January 24, 1949, to Agnes Demetri (Samaras) and Adam Anastos Belushi, a restaurant owner. His father was an Albanian immigrant, from QytezÃ«, and his mother was also of Albanian descent. He grew up in Wheaton, where the family moved when he was six. Though a young hellion in grade school, John became the perfect all-American boy during his high school years where he was co-captain of the Wheaton Central High School football team and was elected homecoming king his senior year. He also developed an interest in acting and appeared in the high school variety show. Encouraged by his drama teacher, John decided to put aside his plans to become a football coach to pursue a career in acting.After graduation in 1967, John performed in summer stock in rural Indiana in a variety of roles from &quot;Cardinal Wolsey&quot; in &quot;Anne of a Thousand Days&quot; to a comic detective in &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;. In the fall of his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater, John changed his image into a bad-boy appearance by growing his hair long and began to have problems with discipline and structure of attending classes.Dropping out of Wisconsin, John spent the next two years at the College of DuPage, a junior college a few miles from his parents&apos; Wheaton home, where his father began persuading him to become a partner in his restaurant, but John still preferred acting. While attending DuPage, John helped found the &quot;West Compass Players&quot;, an improv comedy troupe patterned after Chicago&apos;s famous &quot;Second City&quot; ensemble.In 1971, John made the leap to &quot;Second City&quot; itself where he performed in various on-stage comic performances with others, who included Harold Ramis and Joe Flaherty. John loved his life at &quot;Second City&quot; where he performed six nights a week, perfecting the physical &quot;gonzo&quot; style of comedy he later made famous.A year later, John and his live-in girlfriend from his high school years, Judith Belushi-Pisano, moved to New York because John had joined the cast of National Lampoon&apos;s Lemmings, an off-Broadway rock musical revue that was originally booked for a six-week run but played to full crowds for nearly 10 months.In 1973, John was hired as a writer for the syndicated National Lampoon&apos;s Radio Hour which became the National Lampoon Show in 1975. John&apos;s big break came that same year when he joined the ground-breaking TV variety series Il Saturday Night Live (1975) which made him a star. The unpredictable, aggressively physical style of humor that he began on &quot;Second City&quot; flowered on SNL.In 1978, while still working on Il Saturday Night Live (1975), John appeared in the movie Verso il sud (1978) which starred and was directed by Jack Nicholson. It was here that director John Landis noticed John and decided to cast him in his movie National Lampoon&apos;s Animal House (1978). John&apos;s minor role as the notorious, beer-swilling &quot;Bluto&quot; made it a box-office smash and the year&apos;s top grossing comedy. Despite appearing in only a dozen scenes, John&apos;s performance stole the movie, which portrays college fraternity shenanigans at a small college set in the year 1962.In 1979, John along with fellow SNL regular Dan Aykroyd quit the series to pursue movie projects. John and Dan Aykroyd appeared in minor roles in Steven Spielberg&apos;s financially unsuccessful 1941 - Allarme a Hollywood (1979) and, the following year, in John Landis&apos; The Blues Brothers - I fratelli Blues (1980). Around this time, John&apos;s drug use began escalating. Cocaine, which was ubiquitous in show-business circles in the 1970&apos;s, became his drug of choice. After he first experimented with cocaine in the mid 1970s, John almost immediately became addicted to it. His frequent cocaine sniffing binges became a source of friction between him and Judy, whom he married in 1976.John&apos;s love for blues and soul music inspired the &quot;Blues Brothers&quot;. He and Aykroyd first appeared as Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, a pair of white soul men dressed in black suits, skinny ties, fedora hats and Rayban sunglasses, as a warm-up act before the telecasts of Il Saturday Night Live (1975). Building on the success of their acts and the release of their album &quot;A Briefcase Full of Blues&quot;, John and Dan Aykroyd starred in the movie, which gave John a chance to act with his favorite musical heroes including Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin.Although John&apos;s reputation for being an off-screen party animal is legendary, his generous side is less well known. Using some of his money, he bought his father a ranch outside San Diego for him to live. John helped set up some of his Chicago friends with their own businesses and even financially helped his younger brother, Jim Belushi, who followed his older brother&apos;s path to both &quot;Second City&quot; and Il Saturday Night Live (1975).In 1981, John appeared in the movie Chiamami Aquila (1981), playing a hard-nosed Chicago newspaperman who finds romance in Colorado with eagle expert Blair Brown. That same year, John and Dan Aykroyd appeared again in the movie I vicini di casa (1981), which gave them a chance to reverse roles, with John playing a straight-arrow family man whose life is turned upside down when a wild family man (Aykroyd) moves in next door.In January 1982, John began work on the screenplay for another movie to be titled &quot;Noble Rot&quot;. Also, John had checked into a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont, a popular celebrity hotel in Los Angeles. John&apos;s drug use had been steadily increasing for over a year now, which alarmed his wife and friends, but he continued to promise Judy that he would quit someday. On March 5, 1982, John Belushi was found dead in his hotel room at the age of 33. The local coroner gave the cause of death as a lethal injection of cocaine and heroin. Several years later, John&apos;s drug dealing/drug user companion during his final weeks, Cathy Smith, was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for supplying John with the drugs. Close friend James Taylor sang &quot;That Lonesome Road&quot; at a memorial service at Martha&apos;s Vineyard cemetery where John was buried.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ernst Ingmar Bergman was born July 14, 1918, the son of a priest. The film and T.V. series, Con le migliori intenzioni (1992) is biographical and shows the early marriage of his parents. The film &apos;SÃ¶ndagsbarn&apos; depicts a bicycle journey with his father. In the miniseries Conversazioni private (1996) is the trilogy closed. Here, as in &apos;Den Goda Viljan&apos; Pernilla August play his mother. Note that all three movies are not always full true biographical stories. He began his career early with a puppet theatre which he, his sister and their friends played with. But he was the manager. Strictly professional he begun writing in 1941. He had written a play called &apos;Kaspers dÃ¶d&apos; (A.K.A. &apos;Kaspers Death&apos;) which was produced the same year. It became his entrance into the movie business as Stina Bergman (not a close relative), from the company S.F. (Swedish Filmindustry), had seen the play and thought that there must be some dramatic talent in young Ingmar. His first job was to save other more famous writers&apos; poor scripts. Under one of that script-saving works he remembered that he had written a novel about his last year as a student. He took the novel, did the save-poor-script job first, then wrote a screenplay on his own novel. When he went back to S.F., he delivered two scripts rather than one. The script was Spasimo (1944) and was the fist Bergman screenplay that was put into film (by Alf SjÃ¶berg). It was also in that movie Bergman did his first professional film-director job. Because Alf SjÃ¶berg was busy, Bergman got the order to shoot the last sequence of the film. Ingmar Bergman is the father of Daniel Bergman, director, and Mats Bergman, actor at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater. Ingmar Bergman was also C.E.O. of the same theatre between 1963-1966, where he hired almost every professional actor in Sweden. In 1976 he had a famous tax problem. Bergman had trusted other people to advise him on his finances, but it turned out to be very bad advice. Bergman had to leave the country immediately, and so he went to Germany. A few years later he returned to Sweden and made his last theatrical film Fanny &amp; Alexander (1982) (A.K.A. &apos;Fanny and Alexander&apos;). In later life he retired from movie directing, but still wrote scripts for film and T.V. and directed plays at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre for many years. He died peacefully in his sleep on July 30, 2007.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ingrid Bergman was one of the greatest actresses from Hollywood&apos;s lamented Golden Era. Her natural and unpretentious beauty and her immense acting talent made her one of the most celebrated figures in the history of American cinema. Bergman is also one of the most Oscar-awarded actresses, tied with Meryl Streep, both second only to Katharine Hepburn.Ingrid Bergman was born on August 29, 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, to a German mother, Frieda Henrietta (Adler), and a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman, an artist and photographer. Her mother died when she was only two and her father died when she was 12. She went to live with an elderly uncle.The woman who would be one of the top stars in Hollywood in the 1940s had decided to become an actress after finishing her formal schooling. She had had a taste of acting at age 17 when she played an uncredited role of a girl standing in line in the Swedish film Landskamp (1932) in 1932 - not much of a beginning for a girl who would be known as &quot;Sweden&apos;s illustrious gift to Hollywood.&quot; Her parents died when she was just a girl and the uncle she lived with didn&apos;t want to stand in the way of Ingrid&apos;s dream. The next year she enrolled at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm but decided that stage acting was not for her. It would be three more years before she would have another chance at a film. When she did, it was more than just a bit part. The film in question was Munkbrogreven (1935), where she had a speaking part as Elsa Edlund. After several films that year that established her as a class actress, Ingrid appeared in La sposa scomparsa (1936) as Anita Hoffman. Luckily for her, American producer David O. Selznick saw it and sent a representative from Selznick International Pictures to gain rights to the story and have Ingrid signed to a contract. Once signed, she came to California and starred in United Artists&apos; 1939 remake of her 1936 film, Intermezzo (1939), reprising her original role. The film was a hit and so was Ingrid.Her beauty was unlike anything the movie industry had seen before and her acting was superb. Hollywood was about to find out that they had the most versatile actress the industry had ever seen. Here was a woman who truly cared about the craft she represented. The public fell in love with her. Ingrid was under contract to go back to Sweden to film Solo una notte (1939) in 1939 and Juninatten (1940) in 1940. Back in the US she appeared in three films, all well-received. She made only one film in 1942, but it was the classic Casablanca (1942) opposite Humphrey Bogart.Ingrid was choosing her roles well. In 1943 she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Per chi suona la campana (1943), the only film she made that year. The critics and public didn&apos;t forget her when she made Angoscia (1944) the following year--her role of Paula Alquist got her the Oscar for Best Actress. In 1945 Ingrid played in Io ti salverÃ² (1945), Saratoga (1945) and Le campane di Santa Maria (1945), for which she received her third Oscar nomination for her role of Sister Benedict. She made no films in 1947, but bounced back with a fourth nomination for Giovanna d&apos;Arco (1948). In 1949 she went to Italy to film Stromboli (Terra di Dio) (1950), directed by Roberto Rossellini. She fell in love with him and left her husband, Dr. Peter Lindstrom, and daughter, Pia LindstrÃ¶m. America&apos;s &quot;moral guardians&quot; in the press and the pulpits were outraged. She was pregnant and decided to remain in Italy, where her son was born. In 1952 Ingrid had twins, Isotta and Isabella Rossellini, who became an outstanding actress in her own right, as did Pia.Ingrid continued to make films in Italy and finally returned to Hollywood in 1956 in the title role in Anastasia (1956), which was filmed in England. For this she won her second Academy Award. She had scarcely missed a beat. Ingrid continued to bounce between Europe and the US making movies, and fine ones at that. A film with Ingrid Bergman was sure to be a quality production. In her final big-screen performance in 1978&apos;s Sinfonia d&apos;autunno (1978) she had her final Academy Award nomination. Though she didn&apos;t win, many felt it was the most sterling performance of her career. Ingrid retired, but not before she gave an outstanding performance in the mini-series Una donna di nome Golda (1982), a film about Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. For this she won an Emmy Award as Best Actress, but, unfortunately, she did not live to see the fruits of her labor.Ingrid died from cancer on August 29, 1982, her 67th birthday, in London, England.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Humphrey DeForest Bogart was born in New York City, New York, to Maud Humphrey, a famed magazine illustrator and suffragette, and Belmont DeForest Bogart, a moderately wealthy surgeon (who was secretly addicted to opium). Bogart was educated at Trinity School, NYC, and was sent to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in preparation for medical studies at Yale. He was expelled from Phillips and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. From 1920 to 1922, he managed a stage company owned by family friend William A. Brady (the father of actress Alice Brady), performing a variety of tasks at Brady&apos;s film studio in New York. He then began regular stage performances. Alexander Woollcott described his acting in a 1922 play as inadequate. In 1930, he gained a contract with Fox, his feature film debut in a ten-minute short, Broadway&apos;s Like That (1930), co-starring Ruth Etting and Joan Blondell. Fox released him after two years. After five years of stage and minor film roles, he had his breakthrough role in La foresta pietrificata (1936) from Warner Bros. He won the part over Edward G. Robinson only after the star, Leslie Howard, threatened Warner Bros. that he would quit unless Bogart was given the key role of Duke Mantee, which he had played in the Broadway production with Howard. The film was a major success and led to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. From 1936 to 1940, Bogart appeared in 28 films, usually as a gangster, twice in Westerns and even a horror film. His landmark year was 1941 (often capitalizing on parts George Raft had stupidly rejected) with roles in classics such as Una pallottola per Roy (1941) and as Sam Spade in one of his most fondly remembered films, Il mistero del falco (1941). These were followed by Casablanca (1942), Il grande sonno (1946), and L&apos;isola di corallo (1948). Bogart, despite his erratic education, was incredibly well-read and he favored writers and intellectuals within his small circle of friends. In 1947, he joined wife Lauren Bacall and other actors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts. He also formed his own production company, and the next year made Il tesoro della Sierra Madre (1948). Bogie won the best actor Academy Award for La regina d&apos;Africa (1951) and was nominated for Casablanca (1942) and as Captain Queeg in L&apos;ammutinamento del Caine (1954), a film made when he was already seriously ill. He died in his sleep at his Hollywood home following surgeries and a battle with throat cancer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented Laurence Olivier in terms of esteem. Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams&apos; Un tram che si chiama Desiderio (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando. It was if the shadow of John Barrymore, the great American actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom, dominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any other actor so dominate the public&apos;s consciousness of what WAS an actor before or since Brando&apos;s 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a cultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors circa 1950, such as Paul Muni and Fredric March. Only the luster of Spencer Tracy&apos;s reputation hasn&apos;t dimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However, neither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by the force of his personality. Brando did.Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically inclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. &quot;Bud&quot; Brando was one of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish; his surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named &quot;Brandau.&quot; His oldest sister Jocelyn Brando was also an actress, taking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and mentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another Nebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community Playhouse. Frannie, Brando&apos;s other sibling, was a visual artist. Both Brando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City, Jocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to escape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant father and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big Apple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was the only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was determined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had nothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due to a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military Academy, Brando Sr.&apos;s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as incorrigible before graduation.Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic parents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently intoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act for her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and love. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her, particularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which informed his character Paul in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) (&quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;) when he is recalling his childhood for his young lover Jeanne. &quot;I don&apos;t have many good memories,&quot; Paul confesses, and neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to the town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in the drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young boy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his talent, producing the pearls of his performances. Anthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning co-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told Brando&apos;s first wife Anna Kashfi, &quot;I admire Marlon&apos;s talent, but I don&apos;t envy the pain that created it.&quot;Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator&apos;s Dramatic Workshop at New York&apos;s New School, and was mentored by Stella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish Theatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the &quot;emotional memory&quot; technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and impresario Konstantin Stanislavski, whose motto was &quot;Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully.&quot; The results of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him for a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and culture.Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in &quot;I Remember Mama,&quot; a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando was invited by talent scouts from several different studios to screen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let himself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would make his film debut quite some time later in Fred Zinnemann&apos;s Uomini (1950) for producer Stanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic soldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding on the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni John Garfield, the predecessor closest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it was Garfield whom producer Irene Mayer Selznick had chosen to play the lead in a new Tennessee Williams play she was about to produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an ownership stake in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire.&quot; Burt Lancaster was next approached, but couldn&apos;t get out of a prior film commitment. Then director Elia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had directed to great effect in Maxwell Anderson&apos;s play &quot;Truckline CafÃ©,&quot; in which Brando co-starred with Karl Malden, who was to remain a close friend for the next 60 years.During the production of &quot;Truckline CafÃ©,&quot; Kazan had found that Brando&apos;s presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep Marlon near other major characters&apos; stage business, as the audience could not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando&apos;s character re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him upstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience could still see him as Karl Malden and others played out their scene within the cafÃ© set. When he eventually entered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young Pauline Kael, arriving late to the play, had to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed the young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not look back until her escort commented that the young man was a great actor.The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger than the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting between Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando would make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a younger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was dissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to bring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his characterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of Jessica Tandy&apos;s Blanche Dubois. During the out-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando&apos;s magnetism was attracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to Stanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience&apos;s sympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were identifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter, broaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more of a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred, smitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences.For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley because Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He thought Vivien Leigh, who played the part in the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS Blanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness and nymphomania. Brando&apos;s appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen revolutionized American acting by introducing &quot;The Method&quot; into American consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler&apos;s study at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky&apos;s theories that she subsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic style of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the actor with the character&apos;s emotions. Adler took first place among Brando&apos;s acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an unsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and cosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents.Brando didn&apos;t like the term &quot;The Method,&quot; which quickly became the prominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando denounced Strasberg in his autobiography &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; (1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had been Brando&apos;s mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg along with Kazan and Stella Adler&apos;s husband, Harold Clurman, all Group Theatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the didactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the craft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography &quot;A Life&quot; claimed that Brando&apos;s genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler had given him. Adler&apos;s method emphasized that authenticity in acting is achieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional experienceInterestingly, Elia Kazan believed that Brando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and those who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by employing The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor, that he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut instincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young actor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando&apos;s genius, thought that all it took was to find a character&apos;s motivation, empathize with the character through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all on stage to become the character. That&apos;s not how the superbly trained Brando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your average American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando&apos;s art, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method.After Un tram che si chiama Desiderio (1951), for which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations, Brando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances - in Viva Zapata! (1952), Giulio Cesare (1953) and the summit of his early career, Kazan&apos;s Fronte del porto (1954). For his &quot;Waterfront&quot; portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy, the washed-up pug who &quot;coulda been a contender,&quot; Brando won his first Oscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause Johnny in Il selvaggio (1953) (&quot;What are you rebelling against?&quot; Johnny is asked. &quot;What have ya got?&quot; is his reply), the first wave of his career was, according to Jon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious presentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director John Huston said his performance of Marc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark room, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier Shakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his repertory company.It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting, spawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the &quot;New Brando,&quot; such as Warren Beatty in Kazan&apos;s Splendore nell&apos;erba (1961). &quot;We are all Brando&apos;s children,&quot; Jack Nicholson pointed out in 1972. &quot;He gave us our freedom.&quot; He was truly &quot;The Godfather&quot; of American acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like DÃ©sirÃ©e (1954) and La casa da tÃ¨ alla luna d&apos;agosto (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn&apos;t sought out the parts so largely escaped blame.In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely establish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star, although that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his early career, Sayonara (1957) (for which he received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his hand at directing a film, the well-reviewed I due volti della vendetta (1961) that he made for his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his mother&apos;s maiden name). Stanley Kubrick had been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites in which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and Kubrick was sacked. According to his widow Christiane Kubrick, Stanley believed that Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along.Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning up a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents a foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during production of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing the film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut. Paramount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that Brando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad Longworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the heavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a matter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one&apos;s environment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a gray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This attitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian Diestl in the film he made before shooting I due volti della vendetta (1961), Edward Dmytryk&apos;s filming of Irwin Shaw&apos;s novel I giovani leoni (1958). Shaw denounced Brando&apos;s performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as the film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would have for more than a decade.I due volti della vendetta (1961) generated respectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were exorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a deficit. A film essentially is &quot;made&quot; in the editing room, and Brando found cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio eventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in handling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed another film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct themselves during the shooting of a picture.Between the production and release of I due volti della vendetta (1961), Brando appeared in Sidney Lumet&apos;s film version of Tennessee Williams&apos; play &quot;Orpheus Descending,&quot; Pelle di serpente (1960) which teamed him with fellow Oscar winners Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward. Following in Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s trailblazing footsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million salary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this re-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic Hollis Alpert had published a book &quot;Brando and the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski&quot;). Critics and audiences waiting for another incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were disappointed when the renamed Pelle di serpente (1960) finally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of La gatta sul tetto che scotta (1958) and Improvvisamente, l&apos;estate scorsa (1959) burning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, Pelle di serpente (1960) was a failure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of I due volti della vendetta (1961) in 1961 and then by a failure of a more monumental kind: Gli ammutinati del Bounty (1962), a remake of the famed 1935 film.Brando signed on to Gli ammutinati del Bounty (1962) after turning down the lead in the David Lean classic Lawrence d&apos;Arabia (1962) because he didn&apos;t want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a camel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages as the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal photography, highly respected director Carol Reed (an eventual Academy Award winner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner Lewis Milestone, was shunted aside by Brando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself. The long shoot became so notorious that President John F. Kennedy asked director Billy Wilder at a cocktail party not &quot;when&quot; but &quot;if&quot; the &quot;Bounty&quot; shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one of its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar nomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to go into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20 million, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for inflation.Brando and Taylor, whose Cleopatra (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th Century-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more than twice that of Brando&apos;s Gli ammutinati del Bounty (1962)), were pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the pampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking scapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial pressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and by the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains, causing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking to replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of I dieci comandamenti (1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), were the real culprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found it impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box office.While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of publicity from her adulterous romance with Cleopatra (1963) co-star Richard Burton, remained hot until the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle La scogliera dei desideri (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end of the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he worked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The industry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he continued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968.Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as Missione in oriente - Il brutto americano (1963), A sud ovest di Sonora (1966) and Riflessi in un occhio d&apos;oro (1967). For every &quot;Reflections,&quot; though, there seemed to be two or three outright debacles, such as I due seduttori (1964), I morituri (1965), La caccia (1966), La contessa di Hong Kong (1967), Candy e il suo pazzo mondo (1968), La notte del giorno dopo (1969). By the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture Queimada (1969) in Colombia with Gillo Pontecorvo in the director&apos;s chair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous five years with such top directors as Arthur Penn, John Huston and the legendary Charles Chaplin, and with such top-drawer co-stars as David Niven, Yul Brynner, Sophia Loren and Taylor.The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his potential to be America&apos;s answer to Laurence Olivier, as his friend William Redfield limned the dilemma in his book &quot;Letters from an Actor&quot; (1967), a memoir about Redfield&apos;s appearance in Burton&apos;s 1964 theatrical production of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; By failing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries, something British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando had stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical repertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for an American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while Method actors such as Rod Steiger tried to create an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their king was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his talent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was a crass sellout.Despite evidence in such films as A sud ovest di Sonora (1966) and Riflessi in un occhio d&apos;oro (1967) that Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life, critics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing to live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando&apos;s political activism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native Americans&apos; rights, followed by his participation in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference&apos;s March on Washington in 1963, and followed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not win him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de facto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially, at least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply would not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando would not work for three years.Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was Fortune&apos;s fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of John Barrymore, a similarly gifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them away. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham, evidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious Candy e il suo pazzo mondo (1968), seemingly because the material was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the 1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor Elia Kazan, a relationship that had soured due to Kazan&apos;s friendly testimony naming names before the notorious House un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this, too, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of Kazan&apos;s film adaptation of his own novel, Il compromesso (1969). However, after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Brando backed out of the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film after this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite box-office king Paul Newman in a surefire script, Butch Cassidy (1969), Brando decided to make Queimada (1969) with Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and colonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of progressive critics and cultural arbiters such as Howard Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film Improvvisamente, un uomo nella notte (1971), a prequel to &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot; and another critical and box office failure.Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from Orson Welles, whose greatness lay in film making, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard Burton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his own film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike the public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he himself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando&apos;s problem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten too much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured by normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando&apos;s personality and his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow up outside the limelight.Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in print in the mid-&apos;50s and had as much to do with the public perception of the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors were ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good actor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare genius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an intelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not the actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the other arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert over his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled by a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema that a performance, as is a film, is &quot;created&quot; in the cutting room, thus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had tried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic enterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and the film&apos;s performances are made. This lack of control over his art was the root of Brando&apos;s discontent with acting, with movies, and, eventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in movie actors, as long as &quot;they&quot; were at the top of the box-office charts. Hollywood was a matter of &quot;they&quot; and not the work, and Brando became disgusted.Charlton Heston, who participated in Martin Luther King&apos;s 1963 March on Washington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his generation. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role in the early 1960s with the excuse &quot;How can I act when people are starving in India?,&quot; Heston believes that it was this attitude, the inability to separate one&apos;s idealism from one&apos;s work, that prevented Brando from reaching his potential. As Rod Steiger once said, Brando had it all, great stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a trip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando&apos;s children even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When James Mason&apos; was asked in 1971 who was the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let his career go belly-up, it had to be George C. Scott, by default.Paramount thought that only Laurence Olivier would suffice, but Lord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one actor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had assembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon Brando. Francis Ford Coppola won the fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and Paramount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of all-time, Il padrino (1972), a gangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American films of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone with his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly scandalous Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) (&quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;), the first film dealing explicitly with sexuality in which an actor of Brando&apos;s stature had participated. He was now again a top ten box office star and once again heralded as the greatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put him on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and would make him the highest-paid actor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade. Little did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many projects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best acting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well at the box office, essentially was through with the movies.After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never reached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away. He would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972),&quot; a performance that embarrassed him, according to his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being the &quot;auteur,&quot; or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of &quot;Tango&quot; were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The improvisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and the scripted improvisations were shot the next day. Pauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics in that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of her generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wannabes, said Brando&apos;s performance in Ultimo tango a Parigi (1972) had revolutionized the art of film. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother&apos;s attention; Brando, who believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the world engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted from other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a childish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have agreed with Sam Peckinpah&apos;s summation of Pauline Kael: &quot;Pauline&apos;s a brilliant critic but sometimes she&apos;s just cracking walnuts with her ass.&quot; He probably would have done so in a simulacrum of those words, too.After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major role for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after Jack Nicholson in Arthur Penn&apos;s Missouri (1976), a western that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando&apos;s performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Radici (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of capital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the Salkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of the gross for 13 days work on Superman (1978). Factoring in inflation, the straight salary for &quot;Superman&quot; equals or exceeds the new record of $1 million a day Harrison Ford set with K-19 (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie&apos;s sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage.Before cashing his first paycheck for Superman (1978), Brando had picked up $2 million for his extended cameo in Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Apocalypse Now (1979) in a role, that of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation while Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando&apos;s last bravura star performance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in La formula (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination for his supporting role in Un&apos;arida stagione bianca (1989) after coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those who claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his entire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy Il boss e la matricola (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492 - La conquista del paradiso (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco - Maestro d&apos;amore (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in L&apos;isola perduta (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn&apos;t get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure.Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when &quot;Life&quot; magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were both then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and snowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of Uomini (1950), Brando had gone to live at a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans, and confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks. It was an acting method, research, that no one in Hollywood had ever heard of before, and that willingness to experience life.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Probably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.Burton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said &quot;home is where the books are&quot;. He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.His first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Tempesta a Liverpool (1950) and La quinta offensiva (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Mia cugina Rachele (1952), La tunica (1953) and Alessandro il grande (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the &quot;British New Wave&quot;, and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in I giovani arrabbiati (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Il giorno piÃ¹ lungo (1962), and then onto arguably his most &quot;notorious&quot; role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including International Hotel (1963), Castelli di sabbia (1965), the dynamic Chi ha paura di Virginia Woolf? (1966) and La bisbetica domata (1967), as well as box office flops like I commedianti (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket e il suo re (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play La notte dell&apos;iguana (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller La spia che venne dal freddo (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Dove osano le aquile (1968).His audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Anna dei mille giorni (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Attacco a Rommel (1971), was over the top in the awful Il mascalzone (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Una faccia di c... (1972) and BarbablÃ¹ (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous L&apos;assassinio di Trotsky (1972).By the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Divorzia lui divorzia lei (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), L&apos;uomo del clan (1974), Breve incontro (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and L&apos;esorcista II - L&apos;eretico (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Equus (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in I 4 dell&apos;oca selvaggia (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor &quot;O&apos;Brien&quot; in the most recent film version of George Orwell&apos;s dystopian Orwell 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of Hollywood&apos;s preeminent male stars of all time, James Cagney was also an accomplished dancer and easily played light comedy. James Francis Cagney was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, to Carolyn (Nelson) and James Francis Cagney, Sr., who was a bartender and amateur boxer. Cagney was of Norwegian (from his maternal grandfather) and Irish descent. Ending three decades on the screen, he retired to his farm in Stanfordville, New York (some 77 miles/124 km. north of his New York City birthplace), after starring in Billy Wilder&apos;s Uno, due, tre! (1961). He emerged from retirement to star in the 1981 screen adaptation of E.L. Doctorow&apos;s novel &quot;Ragtime&quot; (Ragtime (1981)), in which he was reunited with his frequent co-star of the 1930s, Pat O&apos;Brien, and which was his last theatrical film and O&apos;Brien&apos;s as well). Cagney&apos;s final performance came in the title role of the made-for-TV movie Terrible Joe Moran (1984), in which he played opposite Art Carney.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ruth Elizabeth Davis was born April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Ruth Augusta (Favor) and Harlow Morrell Davis, a patent attorney. Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.After graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to Eva Le Gallienne&apos;s Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in John Murray Anderson&apos;s Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play &quot;The Earth Between&quot; (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in &quot;Broken Dishes&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Solid South&quot;. Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called Way Back Home (1931). When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had &quot;as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville&quot; and her performance in The Bad Sister (1931) didn&apos;t impress.In 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was Il richiamo dei figli (1931). She became a star after her appearance in The Man Who Played God (1932), known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO&apos;s Schiavo d&apos;amore (1934) that would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn&apos;t win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in Paura d&apos;amare (1935) as Joyce Heath.In 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.Returning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award nomination for her work in Figlia del vento (1938) opposite the soon-to-be-legendary Henry Fonda. The only role she didn&apos;t get that she wanted was Scarlett O&apos;Hara in Via col vento (1939). Warners wouldn&apos;t loan her to David O. Selznick unless he hired Errol Flynn to play Rhett Butler, which both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them George Brent and William Wyler, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.She made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious Peccato (1949). She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill Claudette Colbert in, and received an Oscar nomination for, Eva contro Eva (1950). She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.She received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in Che fine ha fatto Baby Jane? (1962). This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in Piano... piano, dolce Carlotta (1964). Bette was married four times.In 1977 she received the AFI&apos;s Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for L&apos;abisso - Storia di una madre e di una figlia (1979). In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series Hotel (1983), which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.Her last marriage, to actor Gary Merrill, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (&quot;B.D.&quot;) Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called &quot;My Mother&apos;s Keeper.&quot; Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, &quot;This &apos;N That&quot;, during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was &quot;Bette Davis, The Lonely Life&quot;, issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.Sadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France. Many of her fans refused to believe she was gone.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of America&apos;s most prolific actresses was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff on April 3, 1922, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Alma Sophia (Welz), a housewife, and William Joseph Kappelhoff, a music teacher and choir master. Her grandparents were all German immigrants. She had two brothers, Richard, who died before she was born and Paul, a few years older.Her parents divorced while she was still a child, and she lived with her mother. Like most little girls, Doris liked to dance. At fourteen, she formed a dance act with a boy, Jerry Doherty, and they won $500 in a local talent contest. She and Jerry took a brief trip to Hollywood to test the waters. They felt they could succeed, so she and Jerry returned to Cincinnati with the intention of packing and making a permanent move to Hollywood. Tragically, the night before she was to move to Hollywood, she was injured riding in a car hit by a train, ending the possibility of a dancing career.It was a terrible setback, but after taking singing lessons she found a new vocation, and at age 17, she began touring with the Les Brown Band. She met trombonist Al Jorden, whom she married in 1941. Jorden was prone to violence and they divorced after two years, not long after the birth of their son Terry. In 1946, Doris married George Weidler, but this union lasted less than a year. Day&apos;s agent talked her into taking a screen test at Warner Bros. The executives there liked what they saw and signed her to a contract (her early credits are often confused with those of another actress named Doris Day, who appeared mainly in B westerns in the 1930s and 1940s).Her first starring movie role was in Amore sotto coperta (1948). The next year, she made two more films, Musica per i tuoi sogni (1949) and L&apos;amore non puÃ² attendere (1949). Audiences took to her beauty, terrific singing voice and bubbly personality, and she turned in fine performances in the movies she made (in addition to several hit records). She made three films for Warner Bros. in 1950 and five more in 1951. In that year, she met and married Martin Melcher, who adopted her young son Terry, who later grew up to become Terry Melcher, a successful record producer.In 1953, Doris starred in Non sparare, baciami! (1953), which was a major hit, and several more followed: Un pizzico di fortuna (1954), Amami o lasciami (1955), L&apos;uomo che sapeva troppo (1956) and what is probably her best-known film, Il letto racconta (1959). She began to slow down her filmmaking pace in the 1960s, even though she started out the decade with a hit, Non mangiate le margherite (1960).In 1958, her brother Paul died. Around this time, her husband, who had also taken charge of her career, had made deals for her to star in films she didn&apos;t really care about, which led to a bout with exhaustion. The 1960s weren&apos;t to be a repeat of the previous busy decade. She didn&apos;t make as many films as she had in that decade, but the ones she did make were successful: Non disturbate (1965), La mia spia di mezzanotte (1966), Che cosa hai fatto quando siamo rimasti al buio? (1968) and C&apos;Ã¨ un uomo nel letto di mamma (1968). Martin Melcher died in 1968, and Doris never made another film, but she had been signed by Melcher to do her own TV series, The Doris Day Show (1968). That show, like her movies, was successful, lasting until 1973. After her series went off the air, she made only occasional TV appearances.By the time Martin Melcher died, Doris discovered she was millions of dollars in debt. She learned that Melcher had squandered virtually all of her considerable earnings, but she was eventually awarded $22 million by the courts in a case against a man that Melcher had unwisely let invest her money. She married for the fourth time in 1976 and since her divorce in 1980 has devoted her life to animals.Doris was a passionate animal rights activist. She ran Doris Day Animal League in Carmel, California, which advocates homes and proper care of household pets.Doris died on May 13, 2019, in Carmel Valley Village, California. She was 97.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1916-07-01</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Olivia Mary de Havilland was born July 1, 1916, in Tokyo, Japan, to British parents, Lilian Augusta (Ruse), a former actress, and Walter Augustus de Havilland, an English professor and patent attorney. Her sister, Joan, later to become famous as Joan Fontaine, was born the following year. Her surname comes from her paternal grandfather, whose family was from Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Her parents divorced when Olivia was just three years old, and she moved with her mother and sister to Saratoga, California. After graduating from high school, where she fell prey to the acting bug, Olivia enrolled in Mills College in Oakland. It was while she was at Mills that she participated in the school play &quot;A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream&quot; and was spotted by Max Reinhardt. She so impressed Reinhardt that he picked her up for both his stage version and, later, the Warner Bros. film version in 1935.She again was so impressive that Warner executives signed her to a seven-year contract. No sooner had the ink dried on the contract than Olivia appeared in three more films: Colpo proibito (1935), Alibi Ike (1935) and Capitan Blood (1935), the latter with the man with whom her career would be most closely identified, heartthrob Errol Flynn. He and Olivia starred together in eight films during their careers. In 1939 Warner Bros. loaned her to David O. Selznick for the classic Via col vento (1939). Playing sweet Melanie Hamilton, Olivia received her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, only to lose out to one of her co-stars in the film, Hattie McDaniel.After GWTW, Olivia returned to Warner Bros. and continued to churn out films. In 1941 she played Emmy Brown in La porta d&apos;oro (1941), which resulted in her second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress. Again she lost, this time to her sister Joan for her role in Il sospetto (1941). After that strong showing, Olivia now demanded better, more substantial roles than the &quot;sweet young thing&quot; slot into which Warners had been fitting her. The studio responded by placing her on a six-month suspension, all of the studios at the time operating under the policy that players were nothing more than property to do with as they saw fit. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, when her contract with Warners was up, she was told that she would have to make up the time lost because of the suspension.Irate, she sued the studio, and for the length of the court battle she didn&apos;t appear in a single film. The result, however, was worth it. In a landmark decision, the court said not only that Olivia did not have to make up the time, but that all performers were to be limited to a seven-year contract that would include any suspensions handed down. This became known as the &quot;de Havilland decision&quot;; no longer could studios treat their performers as chattel. Returning to screen in 1946, Olivia made up for lost time by appearing in four films, one of which finally won her the Oscar that had so long eluded her. It was A ciascuno il suo destino (1946), in which she played Josephine Norris to the delight of critics and audiences alike. Olivia was the strongest performer in Hollywood for the balance of the 1940s.In 1948 she turned in another strong showing in La fossa dei serpenti (1948) as Virginia Cunningham, a woman suffering a mental breakdown. The end result was another Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but she lost to Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda (1948). As in the two previous years, she made only one film in 1949, but she again won a nomination and the Academy Award for Best Actress for L&apos;ereditiera (1949). After a three-year hiatus, Olivia returned to star in Mia cugina Rachele (1952). From that point on, she made few appearances on the screen but was seen on Broadway and in some television shows. Her last screen appearance was in The Fifth Musketeer (1979), and her last career appearance was in the TV movie The Woman He Loved (1988).Her turbulent relationship with her only sibling, Joan Fontaine, was press fodder for many decades, with the two reported as not speaking and permanently estranged since the death of their mother in 1975, when Joan claimed she had not been invited to the memorial service; which event she claimed she only managed to hold off until she could arrive by threatening to go public. Joan also wrote in her memoir that her elder sister had been physically, psychologically and emotionally abusive when they were young. And the iconic photo of Joan with her hand outstretched to congratulate Olivia backstage after the latter&apos;s first Oscar win and Olivia ignoring it because she was peeved by a comment Joan had made about Olivia&apos;s new husband, Marcus Goodrich, remained part of Hollywood lore for many years.Nonetheless, late in life, Fontaine gave an interview in which she serenely denied any and all claims of an estrangement from her sister. When a reporter asked Joan if she and Olivia were friends, she replied, &quot;Of course!&quot; The reporter responded that rumors to the contrary must have been sensationalism and she replied, &quot;Oh, right - they have to. Two nice girls liking each other isn&apos;t copy.&quot; Asked if she and Olivia were in communication and spoke to each other, Joan replied &quot;Absolutely.&quot; When asked if there ever had been a time when the two did not get along to the point where they wouldn&apos;t speak with one another, Joan replied, again, &quot;Never. Never. There is not a word of truth about that.&quot; When asked why people believe it, she replied &quot;Oh, I have no idea. It&apos;s just something to say ... Oh, it&apos;s terrible.&quot; When asked if she had seen Olivia over the years, she replied, &quot;I&apos;ve seen her in Paris. And she came to my apartment in New York often.&quot; The reporter stated that all this was a nice thing to hear. Joan then stated, &quot;Let me just say, Olivia and I have never had a quarrel. We have never had any dissatisfaction. We have never had hard words. And all this is press.&quot; Joan died in 2013.During the hoopla surrounding the 50th anniversary of GWTW in 1989, Olivia graciously declined requests for all interviews as the last of the four main stars. She enjoyed a quiet retirement in Paris, France, where she resided for many decades, and where she died on 26 July, 2020, at the age of 104.She was the last surviving cast member of Gone with the Wind, and one of the longest-lived actors of Hollywood&apos;s Golden Age, along with Kirk Douglas, who had died earlier the same year at 103.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James Byron Dean was born February 8, 1931 in Marion, Indiana, to Mildred Marie (Wilson) and Winton A. Dean, a farmer turned dental technician. His mother died when Dean was nine, and he was subsequently raised on a farm by his aunt and uncle in Fairmount, Indiana. After grade school, he moved to New York to pursue his dream of acting. He received rave reviews for his work as the blackmailing Arab boy in the New York production of Gide&apos;s &quot;The Immoralist&quot;, good enough to earn him a trip to Hollywood. His early film efforts were strictly small roles: a sailor in the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis overly frantic musical comedy Attente ai marinai! (1952); a GI in Samuel Fuller&apos;s moody study of a platoon in the Korean War, I figli della gloria (1951) and a youth in the Piper Laurie-Rock Hudson comedy Il capitalista (1952).He had major roles in only three movies. In the Elia Kazan production of John Steinbeck&apos;s La valle dell&apos;Eden (1955) he played Cal Trask, the bad brother who could not force affection from his stiff-necked father. His true starring role, the one which fixed his image forever in American culture, was that of the brooding red-jacketed teenager Jim Stark in Nicholas Ray&apos;s GioventÃ¹ bruciata (1955). George Stevens&apos; filming of Edna Ferber&apos;s Il gigante (1956), in which he played the non-conforming cowhand Jett Rink who strikes it rich when he discovers oil, was just coming to a close when Dean, driving his Porsche Spyder race car, collided with another car while on the road near Cholame, California on September 30, 1955. He had received a speeding ticket just two hours before. At age 24, James Dean was killed almost immediately from the impact from a broken neck. His very brief career, violent death and highly publicized funeral transformed him into a cult object of apparently timeless fascination.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Her father was a police lieutenant and imbued in her a military attitude to life. Marlene was known in school for her &quot;bedroom eyes&quot; and her first affairs were at this stage in her life - a professor at the school was terminated. She entered the cabaret scene in 1920s Germany, first as a spectator then as a cabaret singer. In 1924, she married and, although she and Rudolf Sieber lived together only 5 years, they remained married until his death. She was in over a dozen silent films in increasingly important roles. In 1929, she was seen in a Berlin cabaret by Josef von Sternberg and, after a screen test, captured the role of the cabaret singer in L&apos;angelo azzurro (1930) (and became von Sternberg&apos;s lover). With the success of this film, von Sternberg immediately took her to Hollywood, introducing her to the world in Marocco (1930), and signing an agreement to produce all her films. A series of successes followed, and Marlene became the highest paid actress of her time, but her later films in the mid-part of the decade were critical and popular failures. She returned to Europe at the end of the decade, with a series of affairs with former leading men (she had a reputation of romancing her co-stars), as well as other prominent artistic figures. In 1939, an offer came to star with James Stewart in a western and, after initial hesitation, she accepted. The film was Partita d&apos;azzardo (1939) - the siren of film could also be a comedienne and a remarkable comeback was reality. She toured extensively for the allied effort in WW II (she had become a United States citizen) and, after the war, limited her cinematic life. But a new career as a singer and performer appeared, with reviews and shows in Las Vegas, touring theatricals, and even Broadway. New success was accompanied by a too close acquaintance with alcohol, until falls in her performance eventually resulted in a compound fracture of the leg. Although the last 13 years of her life were spent in seclusion in her apartment in Paris, with the last 12 years in bed, she had withdrawn only from public life and maintained active telephone and correspondence contact with friends and associates.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1916-12-09</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cleft-chinned, steely-eyed and virile star of international cinema who rose from being &quot;the ragman&apos;s son&quot; (the name of his best-selling 1988 autobiography) to become a bona fide superstar, Kirk Douglas, also known as Issur Danielovitch Demsky, was born on December 9, 1916 in Amsterdam, New York. His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. Professional wrestling helped pay for his studies as did working on the side as a waiter and a bellboy. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in &quot;Spring Again&quot; before his career was interrupted by World War II. He joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in Lo strano amore di Marta Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama Le vie della cittÃ  (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Sfida all&apos;O.K. Corral (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Sette giorni a maggio (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Due tipi incorreggibili (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: &quot;I&apos;ve finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I&apos;ve got nice-looking girls in my films now.&quot;.After appearing in &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Il grande campione (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in Il bruto e la bella (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Brama di vivere (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick&apos;s brilliant anti-war epic Orizzonti di gloria (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy &quot;Red Scare&quot; hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas&apos; insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Solo sotto le stelle (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story Prima vittoria (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Combattenti della notte (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western Carovana di fuoco (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey&apos;s &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot;, but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk&apos;s talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn&apos;t as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Jack del Cactus (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn 3 (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama L&apos;uomo del fiume nevoso (1982).Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute&apos;s Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remained active and continued to appear in front of the camera. Until his passing on February 5 2020 at the age of 103, he and Olivia de Havilland were the last surviving major stars from the Golden Years of Hollywood.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The women who both attracted and frightened him and an Italy dominated in his youth by Mussolini and Pope Pius XII - inspired the dreams that Fellini started recording in notebooks in the 1960s. Life and dreams were raw material for his films. His native Rimini and characters like Saraghina (the devil herself said the priests who ran his school) - and the Gambettola farmhouse of his paternal grandmother would be remembered in several films. His traveling salesman father Urbano Fellini showed up in La dolce vita (1960) and 8Â½ (1963). His mother Ida Barbiani was from Rome and accompanied him there in 1939. He enrolled in the University of Rome. Intrigued by the image of reporters in American films, he tried out the real life role of journalist and caught the attention of several editors with his caricatures and cartoons and then started submitting articles. Several articles were recycled into a radio series about newlyweds &quot;Cico and Pallina&quot;. Pallina was played by acting student Giulietta Masina, who became his real life wife from October 30, 1943, until his death half a century later. The young Fellini loved vaudeville and was befriended in 1940 by leading comedian Aldo Fabrizi. Roberto Rossellini wanted Fabrizi to play Don Pietro in Roma cittÃ  aperta (1945) and made the contact through Fellini. Fellini worked on that film&apos;s script and is on the credits for Rosselini&apos;s PaisÃ  (1946). On that film he wandered into the editing room, started observing how Italian films were made (a lot like the old silent films with an emphasis on visual effects, dialogue dubbed in later). Fellini in his mid-20s had found his life&apos;s work.</rdfs:comment>

His recent ancestry included Dutch, English, and Scottish.Fonda started his acting debut with the Omaha Community Playhouse, a local amateur theater troupe directed by Dorothy Brando. He moved to the Cape Cod University Players and later Broadway, New York to expand his theatrical career from 1926 to 1934. His first major roles in Broadway include &quot;New Faces of America&quot; and &quot;The Farmer Takes a Wife&quot;. The latter play was transferred to the screen in 1935 and became the start-up of Fonda&apos;s lifelong Hollywood career. The following year he married Frances Seymour Fonda with whom he had two children: Jane Fonda and Peter Fonda, also to become screen stars (his granddaughter is actress Bridget Fonda). He is most remembered for his roles as Abe Lincoln in Alba di gloria (1939), Tom Joad in Furore (1940), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination, and more recently, Norman Thayer in Sul lago dorato (1981), for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1982. Henry Fonda is considered one of Hollywood&apos;s old-time legends and was friend and contemporary of James Stewart, John Ford and Joshua Logan. His movie career which spanned almost 50 years is completed by a notable presence in American theater and television.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland on October 22, 1917, in Tokyo, Japan, in what was known as the International Settlement. Her father was a British patent attorney with a lucrative practice in Japan, but due to Joan and older sister Olivia de Havilland&apos;s recurring ailments the family moved to California in the hopes of improving their health. Mrs. de Havilland and the two girls settled in Saratoga while their father went back to his practice in Japan. Joan&apos;s parents did not get along well and divorced soon afterward. Mrs. de Havilland had a desire to be an actress but her dreams were curtailed when she married, but now she hoped to pass on her dream to Olivia and Joan. While Olivia pursued a stage career, Joan went back to Tokyo, where she attended the American School. In 1934 she came back to California, where her sister was already making a name for herself on the stage. Joan likewise joined a theater group in San Jose and then Los Angeles to try her luck there. After moving to L.A., Joan adopted the name of Joan Burfield because she didn&apos;t want to infringe upon Olivia, who was using the family surname. She tested at MGM and gained a small role in Non piÃ¹ signore (1935), but she was scarcely noticed and Joan was idle for a year and a half. During this time she roomed with Olivia, who was having much more success in films. In 1937, this time calling herself Joan Fontaine, she landed a better role as Trudy Olson in You Can&apos;t Beat Love (1937) and then an uncredited part in Dolce inganno (1937). Although the next two years saw her in better roles, she still yearned for something better. In 1940 she garnered her first Academy Award nomination for Rebecca - La prima moglie (1940). Although she thought she should have won, (she lost out to Ginger Rogers in Kitty Foyle, ragazza innamorata (1940)), she was now an established member of the Hollywood set. She would again be Oscar-nominated for her role as Lina McLaidlaw Aysgarth in Il sospetto (1941), and this time she won. Joan was making one film a year but choosing her roles well. In 1942 she starred in the well-received Sono un disertore (1942). The following year she appeared in Il fiore che non colsi (1943). Once again she was nominated for the Oscar, she lost out to Jennifer Jones in Bernadette (1943). By now it was safe to say she was more famous than her older sister and more fine films followed. In 1948, she accepted second billing to Bing Crosby in Il valzer dell&apos;imperatore (1948). Joan took the year of 1949 off before coming back in 1950 with Accadde in settembre (1950) and La seduttrice (1950). In 1951 she starred in Paramount&apos;s La mia donna Ã¨ un angelo (1951), which turned out badly for both her and the studio and more weak productions followed. Absent from the big screen for a while, she took parts in television and dinner theaters. She also starred in many well-produced Broadway plays such as Forty Carats and The Lion in Winter. Her last appearance on the big screen was Creatura del diavolo (1966) and her final appearance before the cameras was Good King Wenceslas (1994). She is, without a doubt, a lasting movie icon.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">William Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901 in Cadiz, Ohio, to Adeline (Hershelman) and William Henry Gable, an oil-well driller. He was of German, Irish, and Swiss-German descent. When he was seven months old, his mother died, and his father sent him to live with his maternal aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, where he stayed until he was two. His father then returned to take him back to Cadiz. At 16, he quit high school, went to work in an Akron, Ohio, tire factory, and decided to become an actor after seeing the play &quot;The Bird of Paradise&quot;. He toured in stock companies, worked oil fields and sold ties. On December 13, 1924, he married Josephine Dillon, his acting coach and 15 years his senior. Around that time, they moved to Hollywood, so that Clark could concentrate on his acting career. In April 1930, they divorced and a year later, he married Maria Langham (a.k.a. Maria Franklin Gable), also about 17 years older than him.While Gable acted on stage, he became a lifelong friend of Lionel Barrymore. After several failed screen tests (for Barrymore and Darryl F. Zanuck), Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM&apos;s Irving Thalberg. He had a small part in The Painted Desert (1931) with starred William Boyd. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in La via del male (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in Io amo (1931) the same year. His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in Lo schiaffo (1932) made him MGM&apos;s most important star.His acting career then flourished. At one point, he refused an assignment, and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra&apos;s Accadde una notte (1934), which won him an Academy Award for his performance. The next year saw a starring role in Il richiamo della foresta (1935) with Loretta Young, with whom he had an affair (resulting in the birth of a daughter, Judy Lewis). He returned to far more substantial roles at MGM, such as Fletcher Christian in La tragedia del Bounty (1935) and Rhett Butler in Via col vento (1939).After divorcing Maria Langham, in March 1939 Clark married Carole Lombard, but tragedy struck in January 1942 when the plane in which Carole and her mother were flying crashed into Table Rock Mountain, Nevada, killing them both. A grief-stricken Gable joined the US Army Air Force and was off the screen for three years, flying combat missions in Europe. When he returned the studio regarded his salary as excessive and did not renew his contract. He freelanced, but his films didn&apos;t do well at the box office. He married Sylvia Ashley, the widow of Douglas Fairbanks, in 1949. Unfortunately this marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1952. In July 1955 he married a former sweetheart, Kathleen Williams Spreckles (a.k.a. Kay Williams) and became stepfather to her two children, Joan and Adolph (&quot;Bunker&quot;) Spreckels III.On November 16, 1959, Gable became a grandfather when Judy Lewis, his daughter with Loretta Young, gave birth to a daughter, Maria. In 1960, Gable&apos;s wife Kay discovered that she was expecting their first child. In early November 1960, he had just completed filming Gli spostati (1961), when he suffered a heart attack, and died later that month, on November 16, 1960. Gable was buried shortly afterwards in the shrine that he had built for Carole Lombard and her mother when they died, at Forest Lawn Cemetery.In March 1961, Kay Gable gave birth to a boy, whom she named John Clark Gable after his father.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of the brightest, most tragic movie stars of Hollywood&apos;s Golden Era, Judy Garland was a much-loved character whose warmth and spirit, along with her rich and exuberant voice, kept theatre-goers entertained with an array of delightful musicals.She was born Frances Ethel Gumm on 10 June 1922 in Minnesota, the youngest daughter of vaudevillians Ethel Marion (Milne) and Francis Avent Gumm. She was of English, along with some Scottish and Irish, descent. Her mother, an ambitious woman gifted in playing various musical instruments, saw the potential in her daughter at the tender age of just 2 years old when Baby Frances repeatedly sang &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; until she was dragged from the stage kicking and screaming during one of their Christmas shows and immediately drafted her into a dance act, entitled &quot;The Gumm Sisters&quot;, along with her older sisters Mary Jane Gumm and Virginia Gumm. However, knowing that her youngest daughter would eventually become the biggest star, Ethel soon took Frances out of the act and together they traveled across America where she would perform in nightclubs, cabarets, hotels and theaters solo.Her family life was not a happy one, largely because of her mother&apos;s drive for her to succeed as a performer and also her father&apos;s closeted homosexuality. The Gumm family would regularly be forced to leave town owing to her father&apos;s illicit affairs with other men, and from time to time they would be reduced to living out of their automobile. However, in September 1935 the Gumms&apos;, in particular Ethel&apos;s, prayers were answered when Frances was signed by Louis B. Mayer, mogul of leading film studio MGM, after hearing her sing. It was then that her name was changed from Frances Gumm to Judy Garland, after a popular &apos;30s song &quot;Judy&quot; and film critic Robert Garland.Tragedy soon followed, however, in the form of her father&apos;s death of meningitis in November 1935. Having been given no assignments with the exception of singing on radio, Judy faced the threat of losing her job following the arrival of Deanna Durbin. Knowing that they couldn&apos;t keep both of the teenage singers, MGM devised a short entitled Every Sunday (1936) which would be the girls&apos; screen test. However, despite being the outright winner and being kept on by MGM, Judy&apos;s career did not officially kick off until she sang one of her most famous songs, &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot;, at Clark Gable&apos;s birthday party in February 1937, during which Louis B. Mayer finally paid attention to the talented songstress.Prior to this her film debut in Pigskin Parade (1936), in which she played a teenage hillbilly, had left her career hanging in the balance. However, following her rendition of &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot;, MGM set to work preparing various musicals with which to keep Judy busy. All this had its toll on the young teenager, and she was given numerous pills by the studio doctors in order to combat her tiredness on set. Another problem was her weight fluctuation, but she was soon given amphetamines in order to give her the desired streamlined figure. This soon produced the downward spiral that resulted in her lifelong drug addiction.In 1939, Judy shot immediately to stardom with Il mago di Oz (1939), in which she portrayed Dorothy, an orphaned girl living on a farm in the dry plains of Kansas who gets whisked off into the magical world of Oz on the other end of the rainbow. Her poignant performance and sweet delivery of her signature song, &apos;Over The Rainbow&apos;, earned Judy a special juvenile Oscar statuette on 29 February 1940 for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor. Now growing up, Judy began to yearn for meatier adult roles instead of the virginal characters she had been playing since she was 14. She was now taking an interest in men, and after starring in her final juvenile performance in Le fanciulle delle follie (1941) alongside glamorous beauties Lana Turner and Hedy Lamarr, Judy got engaged to bandleader David Rose in May 1941, just two months after his divorce from Martha Raye. Despite planning a big wedding, the couple eloped to Las Vegas and married during the early hours of the morning on 28 July 1941 with just her mother Ethel and her stepfather Will Gilmore present. However, their marriage went downhill as, after discovering that she was pregnant in November 1942, David and MGM persuaded her to abort the baby in order to keep her good-girl image up. She did so and, as a result, was haunted for the rest of her life by her &apos;inhumane actions&apos;. The couple separated in January 1943.By this time, Judy had starred in her first adult role as a vaudevillian during WWI in For Me and My Gal (1942). Within weeks of separation, Judy was soon having an affair with actor Tyrone Power, who was married to French actress Annabella. Their affair ended in May 1943, which was when her affair with producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz kicked off. He introduced her to psychoanalysis and she soon began to make decisions about her career on her own instead of being influenced by her domineering mother and MGM. Their affair ended in November 1943, and soon afterward Judy reluctantly began filming Incontriamoci a Saint Louis (1944), which proved to be a big success. The director Vincente Minnelli highlighted Judy&apos;s beauty for the first time on screen, having made the period musical in color, her first color film since Il mago di Oz (1939). He showed off her large brandy-brown eyes and her full, thick lips and after filming ended in April 1944, a love affair resulted between director and actress and they were soon living together.Vincente began to mold Judy and her career, making her more beautiful and more popular with audiences worldwide. He directed her in L&apos;ora di New York (1945), and it was during the filming of this movie that the couple announced their engagement on set on 9 January 1945. Judy&apos;s divorce from David Rose had been finalized on 8 June 1944 after almost three years of marriage, and despite her brief fling with Orson Welles, who at the time was married to screen sex goddess Rita Hayworth, on 15 June 1945 Judy made Vincente her second husband, tying the knot with him that afternoon at her mother&apos;s home with her boss Louis B. Mayer giving her away and her best friend Betty Asher serving as bridesmaid. They spent three months on honeymoon in New York and afterwards Judy discovered that she was pregnant.On 12 March 1946 in Los Angeles, California, Judy gave birth to their daughter, Liza Minnelli, via caesarean section. It was a joyous time for the couple, but Judy was out of commission for weeks due to the caesarean and her postnatal depression, so she spent much of her time recuperating in bed. She soon returned to work, but married life was never the same for Vincente and Judy after they filmed Il pirata (1948) together in 1947. Judy&apos;s mental health was fast deteriorating and she began hallucinating things and making false accusations toward people, especially her husband, making the filming a nightmare. She also began an affair with aspiring Russian actor Yul Brynner, but after the affair ended, Judy soon regained health and tried to salvage her failing marriage. She then teamed up with dancing legend Fred Astaire for the delightful musical Ti amavo senza saperlo (1948), which resulted in a successful comeback despite having Vincente fired from directing the musical. Afterwards, Judy&apos;s health deteriorated and she began the first of several suicide attempts. In May 1949, she was checked into a rehabilitation center, which caused her much distress.She soon regained strength and was visited frequently by her lover Frank Sinatra, but never saw much of Vincente or Liza. On returning, Judy made I fidanzati sconosciuti (1949), which was also Liza&apos;s film debut, albeit via an uncredited cameo. She had already been suspended by MGM for her lack of cooperation on the set of I barkleys di Broadway (1949), which also resulted in her getting replaced by Ginger Rogers. After being replaced by Betty Hutton on Anna prendi il fucile (1950), Judy was suspended yet again before making her final film for MGM, entitled L&apos;allegra fattoria (1950). At 28, Judy received her third suspension and was fired by MGM, and her second marriage was soon dissolved.Having taken up with Sidney Luft, Judy traveled to London to star at the legendary Palladium. She was an instant success and after her divorce from Vincente Minnelli was finalized on 29 March 1951 after almost six years of marriage, Judy traveled with Sid to New York to make an appearance on Broadway. With her newfound fame on stage, Judy was stopped in her tracks in February 1952 when she became pregnant by her new lover, Sid. At the age of 30, she made him her third husband on 8 June 1952; the wedding was held at a friend&apos;s ranch in Pasadena. Her relationship with her mother had long since been dissolved by this point, and after the birth of her second daughter, Lorna Luft, on 21 November 1952, she refused to allow her mother to see her granddaughter. Ethel then died in January 1953 of a heart attack, leaving Judy devastated and feeling guilty about not reconciling with her mother before her untimely demise.After the funeral, Judy signed a film contract with Warner Bros. to star in the musical remake of Ãˆ nata una stella (1937), which had starred Janet Gaynor, who had won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929. Filming soon began, resulting in an affair between Judy and her leading man, British star James Mason. She also picked up on her affair with Frank Sinatra, and after filming was complete Judy was yet again lauded as a great film star. She won a Golden Globe for her brilliant and truly outstanding performance as Esther Blodgett, nightclub singer turned movie star, but when it came to the Academy Awards, a distraught Judy lost out on the Best Actress Oscar to Grace Kelly for her portrayal of the wife of an alcoholic star in La ragazza di campagna (1954). Many still argue that Judy should have won the Oscar over Grace Kelly. Continuing her work on stage, Judy gave birth to her beloved son, Joey Luft, on 29 March 1955. She soon began to lose her millions of dollars as a result of her husband&apos;s strong gambling addiction, and with hundreds of debts to pay, Judy and Sid began a volatile, on-off relationship resulting in numerous divorce filings.In 1961, at the age of 39, Judy returned to her ailing film career, this time to star in Vincitori e vinti (1961), for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but this time she lost out to Rita Moreno for her performance in West Side Story (1961). Her battles with alcoholism and drugs led to Judy&apos;s making numerous headlines in newspapers, but she soldiered on, forming a close friendship with President John F. Kennedy. In 1963, Judy and Sid finally separated permanently, and on 19 May 1965 their divorce was finalized after almost 13 years of marriage. By this time, Judy, now 41, had made her final performance on film alongside Dirk Bogarde in Ombre sul palcoscenico (1963). She married her fourth husband, Mark Herron, on 14 November 1965 in Las Vegas, but they separated in April 1966 after five months of marriage owing to his homosexuality. It was also that year that she began an affair with young journalist Tom Green. She then settled down in London after their affair ended, and she began dating disk jockey Mickey Deans in December 1968. They became engaged once her divorce from Mark Herron was finalized on 9 January 1969 after three years of marriage. She married Mickey, her fifth and final husband, in a register office in Chelsea, London, on 15 March 1969.She continued working on stage, appearing several times with her daughter Liza. It was during a concert in Chelsea, London, that Judy stumbled into her bathroom late one night and died of an overdose of barbiturates, the drug that had dominated her much of her life, on the 22nd of June 1969 at the age of 47. Her daughter Liza Minnelli paid for her funeral, and her former lover James Mason delivered her touching eulogy. She is still an icon to this day with her famous performances in Il mago di Oz (1939), Incontriamoci a Saint Louis (1944), Ti amavo senza saperlo (1948), and Ãˆ nata una stella (1954).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born on February 10, 1929, Jerry Goldsmith studied piano with Jakob Gimpel and composition, theory, and counterpoint with Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. He also attended classes in film composition given by MiklÃ³s RÃ³zsa at the Univeristy of Southern California. In 1950, he was employed as a clerk typist in the music department at CBS. There, he was given his first embryonic assignments as a composer for radio shows such as &quot;Romance&quot; and &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot;. He wrote one score a week for these shows, which were performed live on transmission. He stayed with CBS until 1960, having already scored Ai confini della realtÃ  (1959). He was hired by Revue Studios to score their series Thriller (1960). It was here that he met the influential film composer Alfred Newman who hired Goldsmith to score the film Solo sotto le stelle (1962), his first major feature film score. An experimentalist, Goldsmith constantly pushed forward the bounds of film music: Il pianeta delle scimmie (1968) included horns blown without mouthpieces and a bass clarinetist fingering the notes but not blowing. He was unafraid to use the wide variety of electronic sounds and instruments which had become available, although he did not use them for their own sake.He rose rapidly to the top of his profession in the early to mid-1960s, with scores such as Freud - Passioni segrete (1962), Incontro al Central Park (1965) and Quelli della San Pablo (1966). In fact, he received Oscar nominations for all three and another in the 1960s for Il pianeta delle scimmie (1968). From then onwards, his career and reputation was secure and he scored an astonishing variety of films during the next 30 years or so, from Patton, generale d&apos;acciaio (1970) to Star Trek (1979) and from Chinatown (1974) to I ragazzi venuti dal Brasile (1978). He received 17 Oscar nominations but won only once, for Il presagio (1976) in 1977 (Goldsmith himself dismissed the thought of even getting a nomination for work on a &quot;horror show&quot;). He enjoyed giving concerts of his music and performed all over the world, notably in London, where he built up a strong relationship with London Symphony Orchestra.Jerry Goldsmith died at age 75 on July 21, 2004 after a long battle with cancer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Once told by an interviewer, &quot;Everybody would like to be Cary Grant&quot;, Grant is said to have replied, &quot;So would I.&quot;Cary Grant was born Archibald Alexander Leach on January 18, 1904 in Horfield, Bristol, England, to Elsie Maria (Kingdon) and Elias James Leach, who worked in a factory. His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. However, the real truth was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he would not see his mother again until he was in his late 20s).He left school at age 14, lying about his age and forging his father&apos;s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender&apos;s troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the United States. Their show on Broadway, &quot;Good Times&quot;, ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for Lady Lou - La donna fatale (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62.One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style - &quot;high comedy with polished words&quot;. In Caccia al ladro (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, Intrigo internazionale (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.Although Grant retired from the screen, he remained active. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. By all accounts this position was not honorary, as some had assumed. Grant regularly attended meetings and traveled internationally to support them. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother Dyan Cannon, was working. He later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle - Hollywood, California), Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Airlines in 1987) and MGM.Grant expressed no interest in making a career comeback. He was in good health until almost the end of his life, when he suffered a mild stroke in October 1984. In his last years, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man-show, &quot;A Conversation with Cary Grant&quot;, in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. On November 29, 1986, Cary Grant died at age 82 of a cerebral hemorrhage in Davenport, Iowa.In 1999, the American Film Institute named Grant the second male star of Golden Age of Hollywood cinema (after Humphrey Bogart). Grant was known for comedic and dramatic roles; his best-known films include Susanna! (1938), Scandalo a Filadelfia (1940), La signora del venerdÃ¬ (1940), Arsenico e vecchi merletti (1944), Notorious - L&apos;amante perduta (1946), Un amore splendido (1957), Intrigo internazionale (1959) and Sciarada (1963).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Rita Hayworth was born Margarita Carmen Cansino on October 17, 1918, in Brooklyn, New York, into a family of dancers. Her father, Eduardo Cansino Reina, was a dancer as was his father before him. He emigrated from Spain in 1913. Rita&apos;s American mother, Volga Margaret (Hayworth), who was of mostly Irish descent, met Eduardo in 1916 and were married the following year. Rita, herself, studied as a dancer in order to follow in her family&apos;s footsteps. She joined her family on stage when she was eight years old when her family was filmed in a movie called La Fiesta (1926). It was her first film appearance, albeit an uncredited one. Sotted by Fox studio head Winfield R. Sheehan, she signed her first studio contract, and make her film debut at age sixteen, in La nave di satana (1935), followed by Il segno di Robin Hood (1934). She continued to play small bit parts in several films under the name of &quot;Rita Cansino&quot;. She was Fox dropped her after five small roles, but expert, exploitative promotion by her first husband Edward Judson soon brought Rita a new contract at Columbia Pictures, where studio head Harry Cohn changed her surname to Hayworth and approved raising her hairline by electrolysis. She played the second female lead, Judy McPherson, in Avventurieri dell&apos;aria (1939). After thirteen minor roles, Columbia lent her to Warner Bros. for her first big success, Bionda fragola (1941); her splendid dancing with Fred Astaire in L&apos;inarrivabile felicitÃ  (1941) made her a star. This was the film that exuded the warmth and seductive vitality that was to make her famous. Her natural, raw beauty was showcased later that year in Sangue e arena (1941), filmed in Technicolor.Rita was probably the second most popular actress after Betty Grable. In L&apos;inarrivabile felicitÃ  (1941) with Fred Astaire, was probably the film that moviegoers felt close to Rita. Her dancing, for which she had studied all her life, was astounding. After the hit Gilda (1946) (her dancing had made the film and it had made her), her career was on the skids. Although she was still making movies, they never approached her earlier success. The drought began between La signora di Shanghai (1947) and Champagne Safari (1954). Then after SalomÃ¨ (1953), she was not seen again until Pal Joey (1957). Part of the reasons for the downward spiral was television, but also Rita had been replaced by a new star at Columbia, Kim Novak.Rita, herself, said, &quot;Men fell in love with Gilda, but they wake up with me&quot;. In person, Rita was shy, quiet and unassuming; only when the cameras rolled did she turn on the explosive sexual charisma that in Gilda (1946) made her a superstar. To Rita, though, domestic bliss was a more important, if elusive, goal, and in 1949 she interrupted her career for marriage - unfortunately an unhappy one almost from the start - to the playboy Prince Aly Khan. Her films after her divorce from Khan include perhaps her best straight acting performances, Pioggia (1953) and Cordura (1959).After a few, rather forgettable films in the 1960s, her career was essentially over. Her final film was La collera di Dio (1972). Her career was really never the same after Gilda (1946). Perhaps Gene Ringgold said it best when he remarked, &quot;Rita Hayworth is not an actress of great depth. She was a dancer, a glamorous personality, and a sex symbol. These qualities are such that they can carry her no further professionally.&quot; Perhaps he was right but Hayworth fans would vehemently disagree with him.Beginning in 1960 (age 42), early onset of Alzheimer&apos;s disease (undiagnosed until 1980) limited Rita&apos;s ability. The last few roles in her 60-film career were increasingly small. With 20 years of symptoms, Rita was cared for by her daughter, Yasmin Khan, until Rita&apos;s death at age 68 on May 14, 1987, in New York City.</rdfs:comment>

But dad was Jack Hemingway, son of the Nobel prize winning author Ernest Hemingway and, with that heritage, fame was almost foreordained. By the time she was 21, after the lead in the rape melodrama Stupro (1976), she had a budding movie career, a $1 million promotional contract with Faberge perfume, and her face on magazine covers around the world. But, within the decade, it was all lost. Her sister Mariel Hemingway, whose role in Stupro (1976) had been suggested by Margaux, was a much greater success; she had started drinking heavily; two marriages had failed. In 1988, she checked herself into the Betty Ford Center for rehabilitation. Attempts to parley her recovery from alcohol into a revived career failed and, by the time she was 41, almost nothing was left. She lived alone in a studio apartment, no children, no lover, few friends. Neighbors informed police that she had not been seen for days and, on July 1, they entered through a 2nd floor window. Dental records had to be used to confirm her identity.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Audrey Hepburn was born as Audrey Kathleen Ruston on May 4, 1929 in Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium. Her mother, Baroness Ella Van Heemstra, was of a Dutch descent, and her father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston, was born in Ãšzice, Bohemia, of English and Austrian ancestry.After her parents&apos; divorce, Audrey went to London with her mother where she went to a private girls school. Later, when her mother moved back to the Netherlands, she attended private schools as well. While she vacationed with her mother in Arnhem, Netherlands, Hitler&apos;s army took over the town. It was here that she fell on hard times during the Nazi occupation. Audrey suffered from depression and malnutrition.After the liberation, she went to a ballet school in London on a scholarship and later began a modeling career. As a model, she was graceful and, it seemed, she had found her niche in life--until the film producers came calling. In 1948, after being spotted modeling by a producer, she was signed to a bit part in the European film Nederlands in zeven lessen (1948). Later, she had a speaking role in the 1951 film, Racconto di giovani mogli (1951) as Eve Lester. The part still wasn&apos;t much, so she headed to America to try her luck there. Audrey gained immediate prominence in the US with her role in Vacanze romane (1953). This film turned out to be a smashing success, and she won an Oscar as Best Actress.On September 25, 1954, she married actor Mel Ferrer. She also starred in Sabrina (1954), for which she received another Academy Award nomination. She starred in the films Cenerentola a Parigi (1957) and Arianna (1957). She received yet another Academy Award nomination for her role in La storia di una monaca (1959). On July 17, 1960, she gave birth to her first son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer.Audrey reached the pinnacle of her career when she played Holly Golightly in Colazione da Tiffany (1961), for which she received another Oscar nomination. She scored commercial success again playing Regina Lampert in the espionage caper Sciarada (1963). One of Audrey&apos;s most radiant roles was in the fine production of My Fair Lady (1964). After a couple of other movies, most notably Due per la strada (1967), she hit pay dirt and another nomination in Gli occhi della notte (1967).In 1967, Audrey decided to retire from acting while she was on top. She divorced from Mel Ferrer in 1968. On January 19, 1969, she married Dr. Andrea Dotti. On February 8, 1970, she gave birth to her second son, Luca Dotti in Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland. From time to time, she would appear on the silver screen.In 1988, she became a special ambassador to the United Nations UNICEF fund helping children in Latin America and Africa, a position she retained until 1993. She was named to People&apos;s magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. Her last film was Always - Per sempre (1989) in 1989.Audrey Hepburn died, aged 63, on January 20, 1993 in Tolochnaz, Vaud, Switzerland, from appendicular cancer. She had made a total of 31 high quality movies. Her elegance and style will always be remembered in film history as evidenced by her being named in Empire magazine&apos;s &quot;The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Katharine Hepburn was born on May 12, 1907 in Hartford, Connecticut to a suffragist and a doctor who both always encouraged her to speak her mind, develop it fully, and exercise her body to its full potential. An athletic tomboy as a child, she was very close to her brother Tom; at 14 she was devastated to find him dead, the apparent result of accidentally hanging himself while practicing a hanging trick their father had taught them. For many years afterward, she used his November 8 birthdate as her own. She became shy around girls her age and was largely schooled at home. She did attend Bryn Mawr College, where she decided to become an actress, appearing in many of their productions.After graduating, she began getting small roles in plays on Broadway and elsewhere. She always attracted attention, especially for her role in &quot;Art and Mrs. Bottle&quot; (1931). She finally broke into stardom when she took the starring role of the Amazon princess Antiope in &quot;A Warrior&apos;s Husband&quot; (1932). The inevitable film offers followed; after make a few screen tests, she was cast in Febbre di vivere (1932), opposite John Barrymore. The film was a hit, and after agreeing to her salary demands, RKO signed her to a contract. She made five films between 1932 and 1934. For her third, La gloria del mattino (1933), she won her first Academy Award. Her fourth, Piccole donne (1933), was the most successful picture of its day.But stories were beginning to leak out, of her haughty behavior off- screen and her refusal to play the Hollywood Game, always wearing slacks and no makeup, never posing for pictures or giving interviews. Audiences were shocked at her unconventional behavior instead of applauding it, and so when she returned to Broadway in 1934 to star in &quot;The Lake&quot;, the critics panned her and the audiences, who at first bought up tickets, soon deserted her. When she returned to Hollywood, things didn&apos;t get much better. From the period 1935-1938, she had only two hits: Primo amore (1935), which brought her her second Oscar nomination, and Palcoscenico (1937); the many flops included Quando si ama (1935), Il diavolo Ã¨ femmina (1935), Maria di Scozia (1936), Dolce inganno (1937) and the now-classic Susanna! (1938).With so many flops, she came to be labeled &quot;box-office poison.&quot; She decided to go back to Broadway to star in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1938), and was rewarded with a smash. She quickly bought the film rights, and so was able to negotiate her way back to Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. The film version of Scandalo a Filadelfia (1940), was a box-office hit, and Hepburn, who won her third Oscar nomination for the film, was bankable again. For her next film, La donna del giorno (1942), she was paired with Spencer Tracy, and the chemistry between them lasted for eight more films, spanning the course of 25 years, and a romance that lasted that long off-screen. (She received her fourth Oscar nomination for the film.) Their films included the very successful La costola di Adamo (1949), Lui e lei (1952), and La segretaria quasi privata (1957).With La regina d&apos;Africa (1951), Hepburn moved into middle-aged spinster roles, receiving her fifth Oscar nomination for the film. She played more of these types of roles throughout the 50s, and won more Oscar nominations for many of them, including her roles in Tempo d&apos;estate (1955), Il mago della pioggia (1956) and Improvvisamente, l&apos;estate scorsa (1959). Her film roles became fewer and farther between in the 60s, as she devoted her time to her ailing partner Spencer Tracy. For one of her film appearances in this decade, in Il lungo viaggio verso la notte (1962), she received her ninth Oscar nomination. After a five-year absence from films, she then made Indovina chi viene a cena? (1967), her last film with Tracy and the last film Tracy ever made; he died just weeks after finishing it. It garnered Hepburn her tenth Oscar nomination and her second win. The next year, she did Il leone d&apos;inverno (1968), which brought her her eleventh Oscar nomination and third win.In the 1970s, she turned to making made-for-TV films, with Lo zoo di vetro (1973), Amore fra le rovine (1975) and Il grano Ã¨ verde (1979). She still continued to make an occasional appearance in feature films, such as Torna El Grinta (1975), with John Wayne, and Sul lago dorato (1981), with Henry Fonda. This last brought her her twelfth Oscar nomination and fourth win--the latter currently still a record for an actress.She made more TV-films in the 1980s, and wrote her autobiography, &apos;Me&apos;, in 1991. Her last feature film was Love Affair - Un grande amore (1994), with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, and her last TV- film was Fiocchi di neve per Buddy (1994). With her health declining she retired from public life in the mid-nineties. She died at 96 at her home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1923-10-04</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With features chiseled in stone, and renowned for playing a long list of historical figures, particularly in Biblical epics, the tall, well built and ruggedly handsome Charlton Heston was one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest leading men and remained active in front of movie cameras for over sixty years. As a Hollywood star, he appeared in 100 films over the course of 60 years. He played Moses in the epic film, I dieci comandamenti (1956) , for which he received his first Golden Globe Award nomination. He also starred in L&apos;infernale Quinlan (1958) with Orson Welles; Ben-Hur, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor (1959); El Cid (1961); and Planet of the Apes (1968). He also starred in the films The Greatest Show on Earth (1952); Secret of the Incas (1954); The Big Country (1958); and The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965). A supporter of Democratic politicians and civil rights in the 1960s, Heston later became a Republican, founding a conservative political action committee and supporting Ronald Reagan. Heston&apos;s most famous role in politics came as the five-term president of the National Rifle Association, from 1998 to 2003.Heston was born John Charles Carter on October 4, 1924, in No Man&apos;s Land, Illinois, to Lila (Charlton) and Russell Whitford Carter, who operated a sawmill. He had English and Scottish ancestry, with recent Canadian forebears.Heston made his feature film debut as the lead character in a 16mm production of Peer Gynt (1941), based on the Henrik Ibsen play. In 1944, Heston enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. He served for two years as a radio operator and aerial gunner aboard a B-25 Mitchell stationed in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands with the 77th Bombardment Squadron of the Eleventh Air Force. He reached the rank of Staff Sergeant. Heston married Northwestern University student Lydia Marie Clarke, who was six months his senior. That same year he joined the military.Heston played &apos;Marc Antony&apos; in Julius Caesar (1950), and firmly stamped himself as genuine leading man material with his performance as circus manager &apos;Brad Braden&apos; in the Cecil B. DeMille spectacular Il piÃ¹ grande spettacolo del mondo (1952), also starring James Stewart and Cornel Wilde. The now very popular actor remained perpetually busy during the 1950s, both on TV and on the silver screen with audience pleasing performances in the steamy thriller Furia bianca (1954), as a treasure hunter in Il segreto degli Incas (1954) and another barn storming performance for Cecil B. DeMille as &quot;Moses&quot; in the blockbuster I dieci comandamenti (1956).Heston delivered further dynamic performances in the oily film noir thriller L&apos;infernale Quinlan (1958), and then alongside Gregory Peck in the western Il grande Paese (1958) before scoring the role for which he is arguably best known, that of the wronged Jewish prince who seeks his freedom and revenge in the William Wyler directed Ben-Hur (1959). This mammoth Biblical epic running in excess of three and a half hours became the standard by which other large scale productions would be judged, and it&apos;s superb cast also including Stephen Boyd as the villainous &quot;Massala&quot;, English actor Jack Hawkins as the Roman officer &quot;Quintus Arrius&quot;, and Australian actor Frank Thring as &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot;, all contributed wonderful performances. Never one to rest on his laurels, steely Heston remained the preferred choice of directors to lead the cast in major historical productions and during the 1960s he starred as Spanish legend &quot;Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar&quot; in El Cid (1961), as a US soldier battling hostile Chinese boxers during 55 giorni a Pechino (1963), played the ill-fated &quot;John the Baptist&quot; in La piÃ¹ grande storia mai raccontata (1965), the masterful painter &quot;Michelangelo&quot; battling Pope Julius II in Il tormento e l&apos;estasi (1965), and an English general in Khartoum (1966). In 1968, Heston filmed the unusual western Costretto ad uccidere (1967) about an aging and lonely cowboy befriending a lost woman and her son, which Heston has often referred to as his favorite piece of work on screen. Interestingly, Heston was on the verge of acquiring an entirely new league of fans due to his appearance in four very topical science fiction films (all based on popular novels) painting bleak future&apos;s for mankind.In 1968, Heston starred as time traveling astronaut &quot;George Taylor&quot;, in the terrific Il pianeta delle scimmie (1968) with it&apos;s now legendary conclusion as Heston realizes the true horror of his destination. He returned to reprise the role, albeit primarily as a cameo, alongside fellow astronaut James Franciscus in the slightly inferior sequel L&apos;altra faccia del pianeta delle scimmie (1970). Next up, Heston again found himself facing the apocalypse in 1975: occhi bianchi sul pianeta Terra (1971) as the survivor of a germ plague that has wiped out humanity leaving only bands of psychotic lunatics roaming the cities who seek to kill the uninfected Heston. And fourthly, taking its inspiration from the Harry Harrison novel &quot;Make Room!, Make Room!&quot;, Heston starred alongside screen legend Edward G. Robinson and Chuck Connors in 2022: i sopravvissuti (1973). During the remainder of the 1970s, Heston appeared in two very popular &quot;disaster movies&quot; contributing lead roles in the far fetched Airport 75 (1974), plus in the star laden Terremoto (1974), filmed in &quot;Sensoround&quot; (low bass speakers were installed in selected theaters to simulate the earthquake rumblings on screen to movie audiences). He played an evil Cardinal in the lively Milady (1974), a mythical US naval officer in the recreation of La battaglia di Midway (1976), also filmed in &quot;Sensoround&quot;, an LA cop trying to stop a sniper in Panico nello stadio (1976) and another US naval officer in the submarine thriller Salvate il Gray Lady (1978). Heston appeared in numerous episodes of the high rating TV series Dynasty (1981) and I Colby (1985), before moving onto a mixed bag of projects including TV adaptations of L&apos;isola del tesoro (1990) and Un uomo per tutte le stagioni (1988), hosting two episodes of the comedy show, Il Saturday Night Live (1975), starring as the &quot;Good Actor&quot; bringing love struck Mike Myers to tears in Fusi di testa 2 - Waynestock (1993), and as the eye patch wearing boss of intelligence agent Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies (1994). He also narrated numerous TV specials and lent his vocal talents to the animated movie Hercules (1997), the family comedy Come cani &amp; gatti (2001) and an animated version of Ben Hur (2003). Heston made an uncredited appearance in the inferior remake of Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001), and his last film appearance to date was in the Holocaust themed drama of PapÃ  Rua Alguem 5555 (2003).Heston narrated for highly classified military and Department of Energy instructional films, particularly relating to nuclear weapons, and &quot;for six years Heston [held] the nation&apos;s highest security clearance&quot; or Q clearance.&quot; The Q clearance is similar to a DoD or Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) clearance of Top Secret.Heston was married to Lydia Marie Clark Heston since March 1944, and they have two children. His highly entertaining autobiography was released in 1995, titled appropriately enough &quot;Into The Arena&quot;. Although often criticized for his strong conservative beliefs and involvement with the NRA, Heston was a strong advocate for civil right many years before it became fashionable, and was a recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, plus the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2002, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and did appear in a film or TV production after 2003. He died in April 2008. Truly, Charlton Heston is one of the legendary figures of US cinema.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alfred Joseph Hitchcock was born in Leytonstone, Essex, England. He was the son of Emma Jane (Whelan; 1863 - 1942) and East End greengrocer William Hitchcock (1862 - 1914). His parents were both of half English and half Irish ancestry. He had two older siblings, William Hitchcock (born 1890) and Eileen Hitchcock (born 1892). Raised as a strict Catholic and attending Saint Ignatius College, a school run by Jesuits, Hitch had very much of a regular upbringing. His first job outside of the family business was in 1915 as an estimator for the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company. His interest in movies began at around this time, frequently visiting the cinema and reading US trade journals.It was around 1920 when Hitchcock joined the film industry. He started off drawing the sets (he was a very skilled artist). It was there that he met Alma Reville, though they never really spoke to each other. It was only after the director for Always Tell Your Wife (1923) fell ill and Hitchcock was named director to complete the film that he and Reville began to collaborate. Hitchcock had his first real crack at directing a film, start to finish, in 1923 when he was hired to direct the film Number 13 (1922), though the production wasn&apos;t completed due to the studio&apos;s closure (he later remade it as a sound film). Hitchcock didn&apos;t give up then. He directed Il labirinto delle passioni (1925), a British/German production, which was very popular. Hitchcock made his first trademark film in 1927, Il pensionante (1927) . In the same year, on the 2nd of December, Hitchcock married Alma Reville. They had one child, Patricia Hitchcock who was born on July 7th, 1928. His success followed when he made a number of films in Britain such as La signora scompare (1938) and La taverna della Giamaica (1939), some of which also gained him fame in the USA.In 1940, the Hitchcock family moved to Hollywood, where the producer David O. Selznick had hired him to direct an adaptation of &apos;Daphne du Maurier&apos;&apos;s Rebecca - La prima moglie (1940). After Sabotatori (1942), as his fame as a director grew, film companies began to refer to his films as &apos;Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s&apos;, for example Alfred Hitcock&apos;s Psyco (1960), Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Complotto di famiglia (1976), Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Frenzy (1972).Hitchcock was a master of pure cinema who almost never failed to reconcile aesthetics with the demands of the box-office.During the making of Frenzy (1972), Hitchcock&apos;s wife Alma suffered a paralyzing stroke which made her unable to walk very well. On March 7, 1979, Hitchcock was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award, where he said: &quot;I beg permission to mention by name only four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation, and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen and their names are Alma Reville.&quot; By this time, he was ill with angina and his kidneys had already started to fail. He had started to write a screenplay with Ernest Lehman called The Short Night but he fired Lehman and hired young writer David Freeman to rewrite the script. Due to Hitchcock&apos;s failing health the film was never made, but Freeman published the script after Hitchcock&apos;s death. In late 1979, Hitchcock was knighted, making him Sir Alfred Hitchcock. On the 29th April 1980, 9:17AM, he died peacefully in his sleep due to renal failure. His funeral was held in the Church of Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Father Thomas Sullivan led the service with over 600 people attended the service, among them were Mel Brooks (director of Alta tensione (1977), a comedy tribute to Hitchcock and his films), Louis Jourdan, Karl Malden, Tippi Hedren, Janet Leigh and FranÃ§ois Truffaut.</rdfs:comment>

He came from a wealthy family (the Beedles) that moved to Pasadena, California, when he was three. In 1937, while studying chemistry at Pasadena Junior College, he was signed to a film contract by Paramount. His first starring role was as a young man torn between the violin and boxing in Passione (1939). From then on he was typecast as the boy-next-door.After returning from World War II military service, he got two very important roles: Joe Gillis, the gigolo, in Viale del tramonto (1950), and the tutor in Nata ieri (1950). These were followed by his Oscar-winning role as the cynical sergeant in Stalag 17 (1953). He stayed popular through the 1950s, appearing in such films as Picnic (1955). He spent much of his later time as co-owner of the Mount Kenya Safari Club, dividing his time between Africa and Switzerland.</rdfs:comment>

After receiving a bachelor&apos;s degree in music at USC, he would go on to earn his master&apos;s degree at UCLA and teach music theory there. He later completed his Ph.D. in Music Composition and Theory at UCLA. Horner began scoring student films for the American Film Institute in the late 1970s, which paved the way for scoring assignments on a number of small-scale films. His first large, high-profile project was composing music for Star Trek II - L&apos;ira di Khan (1982), which would lead to numerous other film offers and opportunities to work with world-class performers such as the London Symphony Orchestra. With over 75 projects to his name, and work with people such as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Oliver Stone, and Ron Howard, Horner firmly established himself as a strong voice in the world of film scoring. In addition, Horner composed a classical concert piece in the 1980s, called &quot;Spectral Shimmers&quot;, which was world premiered by the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Horner passed away in a plane crash on June 22, 2015, two months short of his 62nd birthday.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Joseph Frank Keaton was born on October 4, 1895 in Piqua, Kansas, to Joe Keaton and Myra Keaton. Joe and Myra were Vaudevillian comedians with a popular, ever-changing variety act, giving Keaton an eclectic and interesting upbringing. In the earliest days on stage, they traveled with a medicine show that included family friend, illusionist Harry Houdini. Keaton himself verified the origin of his nickname &quot;Buster&quot;, given to him by Houdini, when at the age of three, fell down a flight of stairs and was picked up and dusted off by Houdini, who said to Keaton&apos;s father Joe, also nearby, that the fall was &apos;a buster&apos;. Savvy showman Joe Keaton liked the nickname, which has stuck for more than 100 years.At the age of four, Keaton had already begun acting with his parents on the stage. Their act soon gained the reputation as one of the roughest in the country, for their wild, physical antics on stage. It was normal for Joe to throw Buster around the stage, participate in elaborate, dangerous stunts to the reverie of audiences. After several years on the Vaudeville circuit, &quot;The Three Keatons&quot;, toured until Keaton had to break up the act due to his father&apos;s increasing alcohol dependence, making him a show business veteran by the age of 21.While in New York looking for work, a chance run-in with the wildly successful film star and director Roscoe &apos;Fatty&apos; Arbuckle, resulted in Arbuckle inviting him to be in his upcoming short Il garzone di macelleria (1917), an appearance that launched Keaton&apos;s film career, and spawned a friendship that lasted until Arbuckle&apos;s sudden death in 1933. By 1920, after making several successful shorts together, Arbuckle moved on to features, and Keaton inherited his studio, allowing him the opportunity to begin producing his own films. By September 1921, tragedy touched Arbuckle&apos;s life by way of a scandal, where he was tried three times for the murder of Virginia Rapp. Although he was not guilty of the charges, and never convicted, he was unable to regain his status, and the viewing public would no longer tolerate his presence in film. Keaton stood by his friend and mentor through out the incident, supporting him financially, finding him directorial work, even risking his own budding reputation offering to testify on Arbuckle&apos;s behalf.In 1921, Keaton also married his first wife, Natalie Talmadge under unusual circumstance that have never been fully clarified. Popular conjecture states that he was encouraged by Joseph M. Schenck to marry into the powerful Talmadge dynasty, that he himself was already a part of. The union bore Keaton two sons. Keaton&apos;s independent shorts soon became too limiting for the growing star, and after a string of popular films like Saltarello e la casa smontabile (1920), La barca (1921) and Poliziotti (1922), Keaton made the transition into feature films. His first feature, Senti, amore mio (1923), was produced similarly to his short films, and was the dawning of a new era in comedic cinema, where it became apparent to Keaton that he had to put more focus on the story lines and characterization.At the height of his popularity, he was making two features a year, and followed Ages with Accidenti che ospitalitÃ ! (1923), Il navigatore (1924) and Come vinsi la guerra (1926), the latter two he regarded as his best films. The most renowned of Keaton&apos;s comedies is La palla nÂ° 13 (1924), which used cutting edge special effects that received mixed reviews as critics and audiences alike had never seen anything like it, and did not know what to make of it. Modern day film scholars liken the story and effects to Christopher Nolan Inception (2010), for its high level concept and ground-breaking execution. Keaton&apos;s Civil War epic The General (1926) kept up his momentum when he gave audiences the biggest and most expensive sequence ever seen in film at the time. At its climax, a bridge collapses while a train is passing over it, sending the train into a river. This wowed audiences, but did little for its long-term financial success. Audiences did not respond well to the film, disliking the higher level of drama over comedy, and the main character being a Confederate soldier.After a few more silent features, including Tuo per sempre (1927) and Io... e il ciclone (1928), Keaton was informed that his contract had been sold to MGM, by brother-in-law and producer Joseph M. Schenck. Keaton regarded the incident as the worst professional mistake he ever made, as it sent his career, legacy, and personal life into a vicious downward spiral for many years. His first film with MGM was Il cameraman (1928), which is regarded as one of his best silent comedies, but the release signified the loss of control Keaton would incur, never again regaining his film -making independence. He made one more silent film at MGM entitled Io... e l&apos;amore (1929) before the sound era arrived.His first appearance in a film with sound was with the ensemble piece Hollywood che canta (1929), though despite the popularity of it and his previous MGM silents, MGM never allowed Keaton his own production unit, and increasingly reduced his creative control over his films. By 1932, his marriage to Natalie Talmadge had dissolved when she sued him for divorce, and in an effort to placate her, put up little resistance. This resulted in the loss of the home he had built for his family nicknamed &quot;The Italian Villa&quot;, the bulk of his assets, and contact with his children. Natalie changed their last names from Keaton to Talmadge, and they were disallowed from speaking about their father or seeing him. About 10 years later, when they became of age, they rekindled the relationship with Keaton. His hardships in his professional and private life that had been slowly taking their toll, begun to culminate by the early 1930s resulting in his own dependence on alcohol, and sometimes violent and erratic behavior. Depressed, penniless, and out of control, he was fired by MGM by 1933, and became a full-fledged alcoholic.After spending time in hospitals to attempt and treat his alcoholism, he met second wife Mae Scrivens, a nurse, and married her hastily in Mexico, only to end in divorce by 1935. After his firing, he made several low-budget shorts for Educational Pictures, and spent the next several years of his life fading out of public favor, and finding work where he could. His career was slightly reinvigorated when he produced the short Grand Slam Opera (1936), which many of his fans admire for giving such a good performance during the most difficult and unmanageable years of his life.In 1940, he met and married his third wife Eleanor Norris, who was deeply devoted to him, and remained his constant companion and partner until Keaton&apos;s death. After several more years of hardship working as an uncredited, underpaid gag man for comedians such as the Marx Brothers, he was consulted on how to do a realistic and comedic fall for I fidanzati sconosciuti (1949) in which an expensive violin is destroyed. Finding no one who could do this better than him, he was given a minor role in the film. His presence reignited interest in his silent films, which lead to interviews, television appearances, film roles, and world tours that kept him busy for the rest of his life.After several more film, television, and stage appearances through the 1960s, he wrote the autobiography &quot;My Wonderful World of Slapstick&quot;, having completed nearly 150 films in the span of his ground-breaking career. His last film appearance was Dolci vizi al foro (1966) which premiered seven months after Keaton&apos;s death from the rapid onset of lung cancer. Since his death, Keaton&apos;s legacy is being discovered by new generations of viewers every day, many of his films are available on YouTube, DVD and Blu-ray, where he, like all gold-gilded and beloved entertainers can live forever.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Eugene Curran Kelly was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the third son of Harriet Catherine (Curran) and James Patrick Joseph Kelly, a phonograph salesman. His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of Irish and German ancestry.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest and most powerful studio in Hollywood when Gene Kelly arrived in town in 1941. He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was For Me and My Gal (1942) with Judy Garland. What kept Kelly in Hollywood were &quot;the kindred creative spirits&quot; he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who saw Un americano a Parigi (1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written by George Gershwin and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, Cantando sotto la pioggia (1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as Fred Astaire, but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style.Gene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On November 12, 1929, Grace Patricia Kelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to wealthy parents. Her girlhood was uneventful for the most part, but one of the things she desired was to become an actress which she had decided on at an early age. After her high school graduation in 1947, Grace struck out on her own, heading to New York&apos;s bright lights to try her luck there. Grace worked some as a model and made her debut on Broadway in 1949. She also made a brief foray into the infant medium of television. Not content with the work in New York, Grace moved to Southern California for the more prestigious part of acting -- motion pictures. In 1951, she appeared in her first film entitled 14Âª ora (1951) when she was 22. It was a small part, but a start nonetheless. The following year she landed the role of Amy Kane in Mezzogiorno di fuoco (1952), a western starring Gary Cooper and Lloyd Bridges which turned out to be very popular. In 1953, Grace appeared in only one film, but it was another popular one. The film was Mogambo (1953) where Grace played Linda Nordley. The film was a jungle drama in which fellow cast members, Clark Gable and Ava Gardner turned in masterful performances. It was also one of the best films ever released by MGM. Although she got noticed with High Noon, her work with director Alfred Hitchcock, which began with Il delitto perfetto (1954) made her a star. Her standout performance in La finestra sul cortile (1954) brought her to prominence. As Lisa Fremont, she was cast opposite James Stewart, who played a crippled photographer who witnesses a murder in the next apartment from his wheelchair. Grace stayed busy in 1954 appearing in five films. Grace would forever be immortalized by winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Georgie Elgin opposite Bing Crosby in La ragazza di campagna (1954). In 1955, Grace once again teamed with Hitchcock in Caccia al ladro (1955) co-starring Cary Grant. In 1956, she played Tracy Lord in the musical comedy Alta societÃ  (1956) which also starred Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. The whimsical tale ended with her re-marrying her former husband, played by Crosby. The film was well received. It also turned out to be her final acting performance. Grace had recently met and married Prince Rainier of the little principality of Monaco. By becoming a princess, she gave up her career. For the rest of her life, she was to remain in the news with her marriage and her three children. On September 14, 1982, Grace was killed in an automobile accident in her adoptive home country. She was just 52 years old.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Stanley Kubrick was born in Manhattan, New York City, to Sadie Gertrude (Perveler) and Jacob Leonard Kubrick, a physician. His family were Jewish immigrants (from Austria, Romania, and Russia). Stanley was considered intelligent, despite poor grades at school. Hoping that a change of scenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick&apos;s father sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle, Martin Perveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there seemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something to interest his son, Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result. Kubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess would become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for dealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films.Jack Kubrick&apos;s decision to give his son a camera for his thirteenth birthday would be an even wiser move: Kubrick became an avid photographer, and would often make trips around New York taking photographs which he would develop in a friend&apos;s darkroom. After selling an unsolicited photograph to Look Magazine, Kubrick began to associate with their staff photographers, and at the age of seventeen was offered a job as an apprentice photographer.In the next few years, Kubrick had regular assignments for &quot;Look&quot;, and would become a voracious movie-goer. Together with friend Alexander Singer, Kubrick planned a move into film, and in 1950 sank his savings into making the documentary Day of the Fight (1951). This was followed by several short commissioned documentaries (Flying Padre (1951), and (The Seafarers (1953), but by attracting investors and hustling chess games in Central Park, Kubrick was able to make Paura e desiderio (1953) in California.Filming this movie was not a happy experience; Kubrick&apos;s marriage to high school sweetheart Toba Metz did not survive the shooting. Despite mixed reviews for the film itself, Kubrick received good notices for his obvious directorial talents. Kubrick&apos;s next two films Il bacio dell&apos;assassino (1955) and Rapina a mano armata (1956) brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and in 1957 he directed Kirk Douglas in Orizzonti di gloria (1957). Douglas later called upon Kubrick to take over the production of Spartacus (1960), by some accounts hoping that Kubrick would be daunted by the scale of the project and would thus be accommodating. This was not the case, however: Kubrick took charge of the project, imposing his ideas and standards on the film. Many crew members were upset by his style: cinematographer Russell Metty complained to producers that Kubrick was taking over his job. Kubrick&apos;s response was to tell him to sit there and do nothing. Metty complied, and ironically was awarded the Academy Award for his cinematography.Kubrick&apos;s next project was to direct Marlon Brando in I due volti della vendetta (1961), but negotiations broke down and Brando himself ended up directing the film himself. Disenchanted with Hollywood and after another failed marriage, Kubrick moved permanently to England, from where he would make all of his subsequent films. Despite having obtained a pilot&apos;s license, Kubrick was rumored to be afraid of flying.Kubrick&apos;s first UK film was Lolita (1962), which was carefully constructed and guided so as to not offend the censorship boards which at the time had the power to severely damage the commercial success of a film. Il dottor Stranamore - Ovvero: come ho imparato a non preoccuparmi e ad amare la bomba (1964) was a big risk for Kubrick; before this, &quot;nuclear&quot; was not considered a subject for comedy. Originally written as a drama, Kubrick decided that too many of the ideas he had written were just too funny to be taken seriously. The film&apos;s critical and commercial success allowed Kubrick the financial and artistic freedom to work on any project he desired. Around this time, Kubrick&apos;s focus diversified and he would always have several projects in various stages of development: &quot;Blue Moon&quot; (a story about Hollywood&apos;s first pornographic feature film), &quot;Napoleon&quot; (an epic historical biography, abandoned after studio losses on similar projects), &quot;Wartime Lies&quot; (based on the novel by Louis Begley), and &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (a psycho-sexual thriller).The next film he completed was a collaboration with sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. 2001: Odissea nello spazio (1968) is hailed by many as the best ever made; an instant cult favorite, it has set the standard and tone for many science fiction films that followed. Kubrick followed this with Arancia meccanica (1971), which rivaled Lolita (1962) for the controversy it generated - this time not only for its portrayal of sex, but also of violence. Barry Lyndon (1975) would prove a turning point in both his professional and private lives. His unrelenting demands of commitment and perfection of cast and crew had by now become legendary. Actors would be required to perform dozens of takes with no breaks. Filming a story in Ireland involving military, Kubrick received reports that the IRA had declared him a possible target. Production was promptly moved out of the country, and Kubrick&apos;s desire for privacy and security resulted in him being considered a recluse ever since.Having turned down directing a sequel to L&apos;esorcista (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: Shining (1980). Again, rumors circulated of demands made upon actors and crew. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn&apos;t like Kubrick&apos;s adaptation (indeed, he would later write his own screenplay which was filmed as Stephen King&apos;s Shining (1997).)Kubrick&apos;s subsequent work has been well spaced: it was seven years before Full Metal Jacket (1987) was released. By this time, Kubrick was married with children and had extensively remodeled his house. Seen by one critic as the dark side to the humanist story of Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987) continued Kubrick&apos;s legacy of solid critical acclaim, and profit at the box office.In the 1990s, Kubrick began an on-again/off-again collaboration with Brian Aldiss on a new science fiction film called &quot;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&quot;, but progress was very slow, and was backgrounded until special effects technology was up to the standard the Kubrick wanted.Kubrick returned to his in-development projects, but encountered a number of problems: &quot;Napoleon&quot; was completely dead, and &quot;Wartime Lies&quot; (now called &quot;The Aryan Papers&quot;) was abandoned when Steven Spielberg announced he would direct Schindler&apos;s List (1993), which covered much of the same material.While pre-production work on &quot;AI&quot; crawled along, Kubrick combined &quot;Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Blue Movie&quot; and officially announced his next project as Eyes Wide Shut (1999), starring the then-married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. After two years of production under unprecedented security and privacy, the film was released to a typically polarized critical and public reception; Kubrick claimed it was his best film to date.Special effects technology had matured rapidly in the meantime, and Kubrick immediately began active work on A.I. - Intelligenza artificiale (2001), but tragically suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep on March 7th, 1999.After Kubrick&apos;s death, Spielberg revealed that the two of them were friends that frequently communicated discreetly about the art of filmmaking; both had a large degree of mutual respect for each other&apos;s work. &quot;AI&quot; was frequently discussed; Kubrick even suggested that Spielberg should direct it as it was more his type of project. Based on this relationship, Spielberg took over as the film&apos;s director and completed the last Kubrick project.How much of Kubrick&apos;s vision remains in the finished project -- and what he would think of the film as eventually released -- will be the final great unanswerable mysteries in the life of this talented and private filmmaker.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After training as a painter (he storyboards his films as full-scale paintings), Kurosawa entered the film industry in 1936 as an assistant director, eventually making his directorial debut with Sanshiro Sugata (1943). Within a few years, Kurosawa had achieved sufficient stature to allow him greater creative freedom. L&apos;angelo ubriaco (1948)--&quot;Drunken Angel&quot;--was the first film he made without extensive studio interference, and marked his first collaboration with ToshirÃ´ Mifune. In the coming decades, the two would make 16 movies together, and Mifune became as closely associated with Kurosawa&apos;s films as was John Wayne with the films of Kurosawa&apos;s idol, John Ford. After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made his international breakthrough film Rashomon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Vivere (1952) (Living), the epic I sette samurai (1954), the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Il trono di sangue (1957), and a fun pair of samurai comedies La sfida del samurai (1961) and Sanjuro (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes&apos;ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala, il piccolo uomo delle grandi pianure (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha - L&apos;ombra del guerriero (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;King Lear.&quot; He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Sogni (1990), Rapsodia in agosto (1991) and Madadayo - Il compleanno (1993). Kurosawa&apos;s films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion - but he&apos;s revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Rashomon (1950) as L&apos;oltraggio (1964), I sette samurai (1954), as I magnifici sette (1960), La sfida del samurai (1961), as Per un pugno di dollari (1964) and La fortezza nascosta (1958), as Guerre stellari (1977).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alan Walbridge Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the only child of Ina Raleigh (aka Selina Rowley) and Alan Ladd, a freelance accountant. His mother was English, from County Durham, and his paternal grandparents were Canadian. His father died when he was four. At age five, he burned his apartment playing with matches, and his mother moved them to Oklahoma City. He was malnourished, undersized and nicknamed Tiny. His mother married a house painter who moved them to California--a la &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;--when he was eight. He picked fruit, delivered papers, and swept stores. In high school he discovered track and swimming. By 1931 he was training for the 1932 Olympics, but an injury put an end to those plans. He opened a hamburger stand called Tiny&apos;s Patio, and later worked as a grip at Warner Brothers Pictures. He married his friend Midge in 1936, but couldn&apos;t afford her, so they lived apart. In 1937, they shared a friend&apos;s apartment. They had a son, Alan Ladd Jr., and his destitute alcoholic mother moved in with them, her agonizing suicide from ant poison witnessed a few months later by her son. His size and coloring were regarded as not right for movies, so he worked hard at radio, where talent scout and former actress Sue Carol discovered him early in 1939. After a string of bit parts in &quot;B&quot; pictures--and an unbilled part in Orson Welles&apos; classic Quarto potere (1941)--he tested for Il fuorilegge (1942) late in 1941. His fourth-billed role as psychotic killer Raven made him a star. He was drafted in January 1943 and discharged in November with an ulcer and double hernia. Throughout the 1940s his tough-guy roles packed audiences into theaters and he was one of the very few males whose cover photos sold movie magazines. In the 1950s he was performing in lucrative but unrewarding films (an exception being what many regard as his greatest role, Il cavaliere della valle solitaria (1953)). By the end of the 1950s liquor and a string of so-so films had taken their toll. In November 1962 he was found unconscious lying in a pool of blood with a bullet wound near his heart, a probable suicide attempt. In January 1964 he was found dead, apparently due to an accidental combination of alcohol and sedatives.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Veronica Lake was born as Constance Frances Marie Ockleman on November 14, 1922, in Brooklyn, New York. She was the daughter of Constance Charlotta (Trimble) and Harry Eugene Ockelman, who worked for an oil company as a ship employee. Her father was of half German and half Irish descent, and her mother was of Irish ancestry. While still a child, Veronica&apos;s parents moved to Florida when she was not quite a year old. By the time she was five, the family had returned to Brooklyn. When Connie was only twelve, tragedy struck when her father died in an explosion on an oil ship. One year later her mother married Anthony Keane and Connie took his last name as her own. In 1934, when her stepfather was diagnosed with tuberculosis, the family moved to Saranac Lake, where Connie Keane enjoyed the outdoor life and flourished in the activities of boating on the lakes, skating, skiing, swimming, biking around Moody Pond and hiking up Mt Baker. The family made their home in 1935 at 1 Watson Place, (now 27 Seneca Street) then they moved to 1 Riverside Drive,(now Lake Kiwassa Road). Both Connie and Anthony benefited from the Adirondack experience and in 1936 the family left the Adirondacks and moved to Miami, FL., however, the memories of those carefree Saranac Lake days would always remain deeply rooted in her mind.Two years later, Connie graduated from high school in Miami. Her natural beauty and charm and a definite talent for acting prompted her mother and step-father to move to Beverly Hills, California, where they enrolled her in the well known Bliss Hayden School of Acting in Hollywood. Connie had previously been diagnosed as a classic schizophrenic and her parents saw acting as a form of treatment for her condition. She showed remarkable abilities and did not have to wait long for a part to come her way.Her first movie was as one of the many coeds in the RKO film, Sorority House (1939) in 1939. It was a minor part, to be sure, but it was a start. Veronica quickly followed up that project with two other films. All Women Have Secrets (1939) and Dancing Co-Ed (1939), both in 1939, were again bit roles for the pretty young woman from the East Coast, but she did not complain. After all, other would-be starlets took a while before they ever received a bit part. Veronica continued her schooling, in 1940, while taking a bit roles in two more films, Young as You Feel (1940) and Forty Little Mothers (1940). Prior to this time, she was still under her natural name of Constance Keane. Now, with a better role in 1941&apos;s I cavalieri del cielo (1941), she was asked to change her name and Veronica Lake was born. Now, instead of playing coeds, she had a decent, speaking part. Veronica felt like an actress. The film was a success and the public loved this bright newcomer.Paramount, the studio she was under contract with, then assigned her to two more films that year, La porta d&apos;oro (1941) and I dimenticati (1941). The latter received good reviews from the always tough film critics. As Ellen Graham, in Il fuorilegge (1942) the following year, Veronica now had top billing. She had paid her dues and was on a roll. The public was enamored with her. In 1943, Veronica starred in only one film. She portrayed Lieutenant Olivia D&apos;Arcy in Sorelle in armi (1943) with Claudette Colbert. The film was a box-office smash. It seemed that any film Veronica starred in would be an unquestionable hit. However, her only outing for 1944, Un&apos;ora prima dell&apos;alba (1944) would not be well-received by either the public or the critics. As Nazi sympathizer Dora Bruckmann, Veronica&apos;s role was dismal at best. Critics disliked her accent immensely because it wasn&apos;t true to life. Her acting itself suffered because of the accent. Mediocre films trailed her for all of 1945. It seemed that Veronica was dumped in just about any film to see if it could be salvaged. Mi piace quella bionda (1945), Donne indiavolate (1945), and Miss Susie Slagle&apos;s (1946) were just a waste of talent for the beautiful blonde. The latter film was a shade better than the previous two. In 1946, Veronica bounced back in La dalia azzurra (1946) with Howard Da Silva. The film was a hit, but it was the last decent film for Veronica. Paramount continued to put her in pathetic movies. After 1948, Paramount discharged the once prized star and she was out on her own. In 1949, she starred in the Twentieth Century film Furia dei tropici (1949). Unfortunately, another weak film. She was not on the big screen again until 1952 when she appeared in Stronghold (1951). By Veronica&apos;s own admission, the film &quot;was a dog.&quot; From 1952 to 1966, Veronica made television appearances and even tried her hand on the stage. Not a lot of success for her at all. By now alcohol was the order of the day. She was down on her luck and drank heavily. In 1962, Veronica was found living in an old hotel and working as a bartender. She finally returned to the big screen in 1966 in Footsteps in the Snow (1966). Another drought ensued and she appeared on the silver screen for the last time in 1970&apos;s Flesh Feast (1970) - a very low budget film.On July 7, 1973, Veronica died of hepatitis in Burlington, Vermont. The beautiful actress with the long blonde hair was dead at the age of 50.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Burt Lancaster, one of five children, was born in Manhattan, to Elizabeth (Roberts) and James Henry Lancaster, a postal worker. All of his grandparents were immigrants from Northern Ireland. He was a tough street kid who took an early interest in gymnastics. He joined the circus as an acrobat and worked there until he was injured. It was in the Army during WW II that he was introduced to the USO and acting. His first film was I gangsters (1946), and that made him a star. He was a self-taught actor who learned the business as he went along. He set up his own production company in 1948 with Harold Hecht and James Hill to direct his career. He played many different roles in pictures as varied as Il corsaro dell&apos;isola verde (1952), Da qui all&apos;eternitÃ  (1953), Il figlio di Giuda (1960) and Atlantic City (1980).His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, produced such films as Paddy Chayefsky&apos;s Marty - Vita di un timido (1955) (Oscar winner 1955) and Pranzo di nozze (1956). In the 1980s he appeared as a supporting player in a number of movies, such as Local Hero (1983) and L&apos;uomo dei sogni (1989). However, it will be the sound of his voice, the way that he laughed, and the larger-than-life characters he played that will always be remembered.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Bruce Lee remains the greatest icon of martial arts cinema and a key figure of modern popular media. Had it not been for Bruce Lee and his movies in the early 1970s, it&apos;s arguable whether or not the martial arts film genre would have ever penetrated and influenced mainstream North American and European cinema and audiences the way it has over the past four decades.The influence of East Asian martial arts cinema can be seen today in so many other film genres including comedies, action, drama, science fiction, horror and animation.....and they all have their roots in the phenomenon that was Bruce Lee.Lee was born &quot;Lee Jun Fan&quot; November 27, 1940 in San Francisco, the son of Lee Hoi Chuen, a singer with the Cantonese Opera. Approximately one year later the family returned to Kowloon in Hong Kong and at the age of five, a young Bruce begins appearing in children&apos;s roles in minor films including The Birth of Mankind (1946) and Fu gui fu yun (1948). At the age of 12, Bruce commenced attending La Salle College. Bruce was later beaten up by a street gang, which inspired him to take up martial arts training under the tutelage of &quot;Sifu Yip Man&quot; who schooled Bruce in wing chun kung fu for a period of approximately five years. This was the only formalized martial arts training ever undertaken by Lee. The talented &amp; athletic Bruce also took up cha-cha dancing and, at the age of 18, won a major dance championship in Hong Kong.However, his temper and quick fists got him in trouble with the Hong Kong police on numerous occasions. His parents suggested that he head off to the United States. Lee landed in San Francisco&apos;s Chinatown in 1959 and worked in a close relative&apos;s restaurant. He eventually made his way to Seattle, Washington, where he enrolled at university to study philosophy and found the time to practice his beloved kung fu techniques. In 1963, Lee met Linda Lee Cadwell (aka Linda Emery) (later his wife) and also opened his first kung fu school at 4750 University Way. During the early half of the 1960s, Lee became associated with many key martial arts figures in the USA, including kenpo karate expert Ed Parker and tae kwon do master Jhoon Rhee. He made guest appearances at notable martial arts events including the Long Beach Nationals. Through one of these tournaments Bruce met Hollywood hair-stylist Jay Sebring who introduced him to T.V. producer William Dozier. Based on the runaway success of Batman (1966), Dozier was keen to bring the cartoon character of The Green Hornet to T.V. and was on the lookout for an East Asian actor to play the Green Hornet&apos;s sidekick, Kato. Around this time Bruce also opened a second kung fu school in Oakland, California and relocated to Oakland to be closer to Hollywood.Bruce&apos;s screen test was successful, and The Green Hornet (1966) starring Van Williams aired in 1966-1967 with mixed success. His fight scenes were sometimes obscured by unrevealing camera angles, but his dedication was such that he insisted his character behave like a perfect bodyguard, keeping his eyes on whoever might be a threat to his employer except when the script made this impossible. The show was canceled after only one season (twenty-six episodes), but by this time Lee was receiving more fan mail than the show&apos;s nominal star. He then opened a third branch of his kung fu school in Los Angeles and began providing personalized martial arts training to celebrities including film stars Steve McQueen and James Coburn as well as screenwriter Stirling Silliphant. In addition he refined his prior knowledge of wing chun and incorporated aspects of other fighting styles such as traditional boxing and Okinawan karate. He also developed his own unique style &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot; (Way of the Intercepting Fist). Another film opportunity then came his way as he landed the small role of a stand over man named &quot;Winslow Wong&quot; who intimidates private eye James Garner in L&apos;investigatore Marlowe (1969). Wong pays a visit to Garner and proceeds to demolish the investigator&apos;s office with his fists and feet, finishing off with a spectacular high kick that shatters the light fixture. With this further exposure of his talents, Bruce then scored several guest appearances as a martial arts instructor to blind private eye James Franciscus on the TV series Longstreet (1971).With his minor success in Hollywood and money in his pocket, Bruce returned for a visit to Hong Kong and was approached by film producer Raymond Chow who had recently started &quot;Golden Harvest&quot; productions. Chow was keen to utilize Lee&apos;s strong popularity amongst young Chinese fans, and offered him the lead role in Il furore della Cina colpisce ancora (1971), (aka &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, aka Fists Of Fury&quot;). In it, Lee plays a distant cousin coming to join relatives working at an ice house, where murder, corruption, and drug-running lead to his character&apos;s adventures and display of Kung-Fu expertise. The film was directed by Wei Lo, shot in Thailand on a very low budget and in terrible living conditions for cast and crew. However, when it opened in Hong Kong the film was an enormous hit. Chow knew he had struck box office gold with Lee and quickly assembled another script entitled Dalla Cina con furore (1972) (aka &quot;Fist Of Fury&quot;, aka &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;). The second film (with a slightly bigger budget) was again directed by Wei Lo and was set in Shanghai in the year 1900, with Lee returning to his school to find that his beloved master has been poisoned by the local Japanese karate school. Once again he uncovers the evil-doers and sets about seeking revenge on those responsible for murdering his teacher and intimidating his school. The film features several superb fight sequences and, at the film&apos;s conclusion, Lee refuses to surrender to the Japanese law and seemingly leaps to his death in a hail of police bullets.Once more, Hong Kong streets were jammed with thousands of fervent Chinese movie fans who could not get enough of the fearless Bruce Lee, and his second film went on to break the box office records set by the first! Lee then set up his own production company, Concord Productions, and set about guiding his film career personally by writing, directing and acting in his next film, L&apos;urlo di Chen terrorizza anche l&apos;occidente (1972) (aka &quot;Return of The Dragon&quot;). A bigger budget meant better locations and opponents, with the new film set in Rome, Italy and additionally starring hapkido expert Ing-Sik Whang, karate legend Robert Wall and seven-time U.S. karate champion Chuck Norris. Bruce plays a seemingly simple country boy sent to assist at a cousin&apos;s restaurant in Rome and finds his cousins are being bullied by local thugs for protection.By now, Lee&apos;s remarkable success in East Asia had come to the attention of Hollywood film executives and a script was hastily written pitching him as a secret agent penetrating an island fortress. Warner Bros. financed the film and also insisted on B-movie tough guy John Saxon starring alongside Lee to give the film wider appeal. The film culminates with another show-stopping fight sequence between Lee and the key villain, Han, in a maze of mirrors. Shooting was completed in and around Hong Kong in early 1973 and in the subsequent weeks Bruce was involved in completing overdubs and looping for the final cut. Various reports from friends and coworkers cite that he was not feeling well during this period and on July 20, 1973 he lay down at the apartment of actress Betty Ting Pei after taking a head-ache medicine called Equagesic and was later unable to be revived. A doctor was called and Lee was taken to hospital by ambulance and pronounced dead that evening. The official finding was death due to a cerebral edema, caused by a reaction to the head-ache tablet Equagesic.Fans world-wide were shattered that their virile idol had passed at such a young age, and nearly thirty thousand fans filed past his coffin in Hong Kong. A second, much smaller ceremony was held in Seattle, Washington and Bruce was laid to rest at Lake View Cemetary in Seattle with pall bearers including Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Dan Inosanto. I 3 dell&apos;Operazione Drago (1973) was later released in the mainland United States, and was a huge hit with audiences there, which then prompted National General films to actively distribute his three prior movies to U.S. theatres... each was a box office smash.Fans throughout the world were still hungry for more Bruce Lee films and thus remaining footage (completed before his death) of Lee fighting several opponents including Dan Inosanto, Hugh O&apos;Brian and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was crafted into another film titled L&apos;ultimo combattimento di Chen (1978). The film used a look-alike and shadowy camera work to be substituted for the real Lee in numerous scenes. The film is a poor addition to the line-up and is only saved by the final twenty minutes and the footage of the real Bruce Lee battling his way up the tower. Amazingly this same shoddy process was used to create L&apos;ultima sfida di Bruce Lee (1981) (A.K.A. &quot;Game of Death II&quot;), with a look-alike and more stunt doubles interwoven with a few brief minutes of footage of the real Bruce Lee.Tragically his son Brandon Lee, an actor and martial artist like his father, was killed in a freak accident on the set of Il corvo - The Crow (1994).Bruce Lee was not only an amazing athlete and martial artist but he possessed genuine superstar charisma and through a handful of films he left behind an indelible impression on the tapestry of modern cinema.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">If a film were made of the life of Vivien Leigh, it would open in India just before World War I, where a successful British businessman could live like a prince. In the mountains above Calcutta, a little princess is born. Because of the outbreak of World War I, she is six years old the first time her parents take her to England. Her mother thinks she should have a proper English upbringing and insists on leaving her in a convent school - even though Vivien is two years younger than any of the other girls at the school. The only comfort for the lonely child is a cat that was in the courtyard of the school that the nuns let her take up to her dormitory. Her first and best friend at the school is an eight-year-old girl, Maureen O&apos;Sullivan who has been transplanted from Ireland. In the bleakness of a convent school, the two girls can recreate in their imaginations the places they have left and places where they would some day like to travel. After Vivien has been at the school for 18 months, her mother comes again from India and takes her to a play in London. In the next six months Vivien will insist on seeing the same play 16 times. In India the British community entertained themselves at amateur theatricals and Vivien&apos;s father was a leading man. Pupils at the English convent school are eager to perform in school plays. It&apos;s an all-girls school, so some of the girls have to play the male roles. The male roles are so much more adventurous. Vivien&apos;s favorite actor is Leslie Howard, and at 19 she marries an English barrister who looks very much like him. The year is 1932. Vivien&apos;s best friend from that convent school has gone to California, where she&apos;s making movies. Vivien has an opportunity to play a small role in an English film, Things Are Looking Up (1935). She has only one line but the camera keeps returning to her face. The London stage is more exciting than the movies being filmed in England, and the most thrilling actor on that stage is Laurence Olivier. At a party Vivien finds out about a stage role, &quot;The Green Sash&quot;, where the only requirement is that the leading lady be beautiful. The play has a very brief run, but now she is a real actress. An English film is going to be made about Elizabeth I. Laurence gets the role of a young favorite of the queen who is sent to Spain. Vivien gets a much smaller role as a lady-in-waiting of the queen who is in love with Laurence&apos;s character. In real life, both fall in love while making this film, Elisabetta d&apos;inghilterra (1937). In 1938, Hollywood wants Laurence to play Heathcliff in Cime tempestose (1939). Vivien, who has just recently read Via col vento (1939), thinks that the role of Scarlett O&apos;Hara is the first role for an actress that would be really exciting to bring to the screen. She sails to America for a brief vacation. In New York she gets on a plane for the first time to rush to California to see Laurence. They have dinner with Myron Selznick the night that his brother, David O. Selznick, is burning Atlanta on a backlot of MGM (actually they are burning old sets that go back to the early days of silent films to make room to recreate an Atlanta of the 1860s). Vivien is 26 when Via col vento (1939) makes a sweep of the Oscars in 1939. So let&apos;s show 26-year-old Vivien walking up to the stage to accept her Oscar and then as the Oscar is presented the camera focuses on Vivien&apos;s face and through the magic of digitally altering images, the 26-year-old face merges into the face of Vivien at age 38 getting her second Best Actress Oscar for portraying Blanche DuBois in Un tram che si chiama Desiderio (1951). She wouldn&apos;t have returned to America to make that film had not Laurence been going over there to do a film, Gli occhi che non sorrisero (1952) based on Theodore Dreiser&apos;s novel &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;. Laurence tells their friends that his motive for going to Hollywood to make films is to get enough money to produce his own plays for the London stage. He even has his own theater there, the St. James. Now Sir Laurence, with a seat in the British House of Lords, is accompanied by Vivien the day the Lords are debating about whether the St James should be torn down. Breaking protocol, Vivien speaks up and is escorted from the House of Lords. The publicity helps raise the funds to save the St. James. Throughout their two-decade marriage Laurence and Vivien were acting together on the stage in London and New York. Vivien was no longer Lady Olivier when she performed her last major film role, La primavera romana della signora Stone (1961).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1934-09-20</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sophia Loren was born as Sofia Scicolone at the Clinica Regina Margherita in Rome, Italy, on September 20, 1934. Her father, Riccardo Scicolone, was married to another woman and refused to marry her mother, Romilda Villani, despite the fact that she was the mother of his two children (Sophia and her younger sister Maria Scicolone). Growing up in the slums of Pozzuoli during the second World War without any support from her father, she experienced much sadness in her childhood. Her life took an unexpected turn for the best when, at age 14, she entered into a beauty contest where she placed as one of the finalists. It was there that Sophia caught the attention of film producer Carlo Ponti, some 22 years her senior, whom she eventually married in 1966 once he finally obtained a divorce from his first wife. Perhaps he was the only father figure she ever had. Under his guidance, Sophia was put under contract and appeared as an extra in ten films beginning in 1950, before working her way up to supporting roles. In these early films, she was credited as &quot;Sofia Lazzaro&quot; because people joked her beauty could raise Lazzarus from the dead.By her late teens, Sophia was playing lead roles in many Italian features such as La favorita (1952) and Aida (1953). In 1957, she embarked on a successful acting career in the United States, starring in Il ragazzo sul delfino (1957), TimbuctÃ¹ (1957), and Orgoglio e passione (1957) that year. She had a short-lived but much-publicized fling with co-star Cary Grant, who was 31 years her senior. She was only 22 while he was 53, and she rejected a marriage proposal from him. They were paired together a second time in the family-friendly romantic comedy Un marito per Cinzia (1958). While under contract to Paramount Pictures, Sophia starred in Desiderio sotto gli olmi (1958), La chiave (1958), Orchidea nera (1958), La baia di Napoli (1960), Il diavolo in calzoncini rosa (1960), Olympia (1960), and La miliardaria (1960) before returning to Italy to star in La ciociara (1960). The film was a period piece about a woman living in war-torn Italy who is raped while trying to protect her young daughter. Originally cast as the more glamorous child, Sophia fought against type and was re-cast as the mother, evidencing a lack of vanity and proving herself as a genuine actress. This performance received international acclaim and was honored with an Academy Award for Best Actress.Sophia remained a bona fide international movie star throughout the sixties and seventies, making films on both sides of the Atlantic, and starring opposite such leading men as Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, and Charlton Heston. Her American films included El Cid (1961), La caduta dell&apos;impero romano (1964), Arabesque (1966), L&apos;uomo della Mancha (1972), and Cassandra Crossing (1976). She gained a wider respect with her Italian films, especially Matrimonio all&apos;italiana (1964) and Una giornata particolare (1977). During these years she received a second Oscar nomination and won five Golden Globe Awards.From the eighties onward, Sophia&apos;s appearances on the big screen came few and far between. She preferred to spend the majority of her time raising sons Carlo Jr. (b. 1969) and Eduardo (b. 1973). Her only acting credits during the decade were five television films, beginning with Sophia Loren: Her Own Story (1980), a biopic in which she portrayed herself and her mother. She ventured into other areas of business and became the first actress to launch her own fragrance and design of eye wear. In 1982 she voluntarily spent nineteen days in jail for tax evasion.In 1991 Sophia received an Honorary Academy Award for her body of work, and was declared &quot;one of world cinema&apos;s greatest treasures.&quot; Later that year, she experienced a great loss when her mother died of cancer. Her return to mainstream films in PrÃªt-Ã -Porter (1994) (&quot;Ready to Wear&quot;) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. She followed this up with her biggest U.S. hit in years, the comedy That&apos;s amore! Due improbabili seduttori (1995) in which she played a sexy divorcÃ©e who seduces Walter Matthau. Over the next decade Sophia had plum roles in a few non-mainstream arthouse films like Soleil (1997), Cuori estranei (2002) (directed by Edoardo), and La terra del ritorno (2004). Still beautiful at 72, she posed scantily-clad for the 2007 Pirelli Calendar. Sadly, that same year she mourned the loss of her spouse, Carlo Ponti, who died at age 94. In 2009, after far too much time away from film, she appeared in the musical Nine (2009) opposite Daniel Day-Lewis. These days Sophia is based in Switzerland but frequently travels to Los Angeles to spend time with her sons and their families (Eduardo is married to actress Sasha Alexander). Sophia Loren remains one of the most beloved and recognizable figures in the international film world.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Peter Lorre was born LÃ¡szlÃ³ Lowenstein on RÃ³zsahegy, Hungary. He was educated in elementary and secondary schools in Vienna, Austria. As a youth, he ran away from home, worked as a bank clerk and, after stage training in Vienna, made his acting debut in Zurich. He remained unknown, traveling for several years and acting in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, until Fritz Lang cast him as the psychopathic child killer in M - Il mostro di DÃ¼sseldorf (1931). After several more films in Germany, Lorre left as the Nazis came to power, going to Paris, London and, in 1935, Hollywood. He played Raskolnikov in Ho ucciso! (1935) and a series of Mr. Moto movies during the late 1930s. He began his pairing with Sydney Greenstreet as Joel Cairo in Il mistero del falco (1941), continued in Casablanca (1942) and seven other films during the early 1940s. In Germany, he wrote, directed and starred in Un uomo perduto (1951). After that, somewhat heavier, he played in a string of not-so-stellar efforts, one exception being his role as a clown in Il grande circo (1959). He died from a stroke the year he made his last movie, playing a stooge in Jerry Lewis&apos; Jerry 8 e 3/4 (1964).</rdfs:comment>

Goodman offered him a job and, after serving in WWII, he joined the rearranged Glenn Miller band. In 1952, he was given a two-week assignment at Universal to work on an Bud Abbott and Lou Costello film and ended up staying for six years. Success with La storia di Glenn Miller (1954) allowed him to score many other films, helping along the way to change the style of film background music by injecting jazz into the traditional orchestral arrangements of the 1950s. He was nominated for 18 Oscars and won four; in addition, he won 20 Grammys and 2 Emmys, made over 50 albums and had 500 works published. Mancini collaborated extensively with Blake Edwards -- firstly on TV&apos;s Peter Gunn (1958), then on Colazione da Tiffany (1961), which won him two Oscars; he won further Oscars for the titles song for I giorni del vino e delle rose (1962) and the score for Victor Victoria (1982); he will be best-remembered for the theme tune for La pantera rosa (1963).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James Mason was a great English actor of British and American films. He was born in Yorkshire, and attended Marlborough College and Cambridge University, where he discovered acting on a lark, and abandoned a planned career as an architect. Following 4 years in repertory companies, he joined the Old Vic under the guidance of Sir Tyrone Guthrie and of Alexander Korda, who gave Mason a small film role in &apos;The Return of Don Juan&apos; in 1933, but fired him a few days into shooting. Mason remained in the theatre becoming a prominent stage actor, meanwhile getting first small, then rapidly larger roles in &quot;quota quickies&quot;, minor films made to accommodate laws mandating a certain percentage of films shown in Britain to be British-made. Mason&apos;s talent for playing protagonists of a decidedly hard-bitten or melancholy stripe brought him from these minor films to a position as one of Britain&apos;s major film stars of the 1940s. When, late in that decade, he came to America, he played somewhat more glamorous or heroic roles than he had been accustomed to in Britain, but he remained a dynamic and intelligent force on the screen. His tendency to take any job offered led him to have many unworthy credits on his resume but, throughout his career, he remained a respected and powerful figure in the industry. His mellifluous voice and an uncanny ability to suggest rampant emotion beneath a face of absolute calm made him a fascinating performer to watch. He died of a heart attack in 1984 at his home in Switzerland.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Marcello Mastroianni was born in Fontana Liri, Italy in 1924, but soon his family moved to Turin and then Rome. During WW2 he was sent to a German prison camp, but he managed to escape and hide in Venice. He debuted in films as an extra in Marionette (1939), then started working for the Italian department of &quot;Eagle Lion Films&quot; in Rome and joined a drama club, where he was discovered by director Luchino Visconti. In 1957 Visconti gave him the starring part in his Fyodor Dostoevsky adaptation Le notti bianche (1957) and in 1958 he was fine as a little thief in Mario Monicelli&apos;s comedy I soliti ignoti (1958). But his real breakthrough came in 1960, when Federico Fellini cast him as an attractive, weary-eyed journalist of the Rome jet-set in La dolce vita (1960); that film was the genesis of his &quot;Latin lover&quot; persona, which Mastroianni himself often denied by accepting parts of passive and sensitive men. He would again work with Fellini in several major films, like the exquisite 8Â½ (1963) (as a movie director who finds himself at a point of crisis) and the touching Ginger e Fred (1986) (as an old entertainer who appears in a TV show). He also appeared as a tired novelist with marital problems in Michelangelo Antonioni&apos;s La notte (1961), as an impotent young man in Mauro Bolognini&apos;s Il bell&apos;Antonio (1960) , as an exiled prince in John Boorman&apos;s Leone l&apos;ultimo (1970), as a traitor in Paolo and Vittorio Taviani&apos;s AllonsanfÃ n (1974) and as a sensitive homosexual in love with a housewife in Ettore Scola&apos;s Una giornata particolare (1977). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor three times, for Divorzio all&apos;italiana (1961), Una giornata particolare (1977), and Oci ciornie (1987). During the last decade of his life he worked with directors, like Theodoros Angelopoulos, Bertrand Blier and Raoul Ruiz, who gave him three excellent parts in Tre vite e una sola morte (1996). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1996.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Robert Mitchum was an underrated American leading man of enormous ability, who sublimated his talents beneath an air of disinterest. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Ann Harriet (Gunderson), a Norwegian immigrant, and James Thomas Mitchum, a shipyard/railroad worker. His father died in a train accident when he was two, and Robert and his siblings (including brother John Mitchum, later also an actor) were raised by his mother and stepfather (a British army major) in Connecticut, New York, and Delaware. An early contempt for authority led to discipline problems, and Mitchum spent good portions of his teen years adventuring on the open road. He later claimed that on one of these trips, at the age of 14, he was charged with vagrancy and sentenced to a Georgia chain gang, from which he escaped. Working a wide variety of jobs (including ghostwriter for astrologist Carroll Righter), Mitchum discovered acting in a Long Beach, California, amateur theater company. He worked at Lockheed Aircraft, where job stress caused him to suffer temporary blindness. About this time he began to obtain small roles in films, appearing in dozens within a very brief time. In 1945, he was cast as Lt. Walker in I forzati della gloria (1945) and received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His star ascended rapidly, and he became an icon of 1940s film noir, though equally adept at westerns and romantic dramas. His apparently lazy style and seen-it-all demeanor proved highly attractive to men and women, and by the 1950s, he was a true superstar despite a brief prison term for marijuana usage in 1949, which seemed to enhance rather than diminish his &quot;bad boy&quot; appeal. Though seemingly dismissive of &quot;art,&quot; he worked in tremendously artistically thoughtful projects such as Charles Laughton&apos;s La morte corre sul fiume (1955) and even co-wrote and composed an oratorio produced at the Hollywood Bowl by Orson Welles. A master of accents and seemingly unconcerned about his star image, he played in both forgettable and unforgettable films with unswerving nonchalance, leading many to overlook the prodigious talent he can bring to a project that he finds compelling. He moved into television in the 1980s as his film opportunities diminished, winning new fans with Venti di guerra (1983) and Ricordi di guerra (1988). His sons James Mitchum and Christopher Mitchum are actors, as is his grandson Bentley Mitchum. His last film was James Dean: Live Fast, Die Young (1997) with Casper Van Dien as James Dean.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1926-06-01</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Marilyn Monroe was an American actress, comedienne, singer, and model. She became one of the world&apos;s most enduring iconic figures and is remembered both for her winsome embodiment of the Hollywood sex symbol and her tragic personal and professional struggles within the film industry. Her life and death are still the subjects of much controversy and speculation. She was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926. Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn&apos;s father&apos;s identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and rarely had contact with young Marilyn. Once Marilyn became an adult and celebrated as a film star, she paid a woman by the name of Inez Melson to look in on the institutionalized Gladys and give detailed reports of her progress. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys&apos; best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan&apos;s Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan&apos;s Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace&apos;s husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace&apos;s Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana&apos;s advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddards. The Goddards planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 400 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors&apos; lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Orchidea bionda (1948) in which she sang three numbers : &quot;Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Tell I Love You&quot; and &quot;The Ladies of the Chorus&quot; with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in Giungla d&apos;asfalto (1950) and put her in Eva contro Eva (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Niagara (1953) and Gli uomini preferiscono le bionde (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the Quando la moglie Ã¨ in vacanza (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After Quando la moglie Ã¨ in vacanza (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York&apos;s Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Fermata d&apos;autobus (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made Il principe e la ballerina (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture Gli spostati (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something&apos;s Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe&apos;s day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn&apos;s physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document &quot;felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to&quot;. Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn&apos;s house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn&apos;t stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband&apos;s son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a &apos;probable suicide&apos;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Screen legend, superstar, and the man with the most famous blue eyes in movie history, Paul Leonard Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, the second son of Arthur Sigmund Newman (died 1950) and Theresa Fetsko (died 1982). His elder brother was , Arthur S. Newman Jr., named for their father, a Jewish businessman who owned a successful sporting goods store and was the son of emigrants from Poland and Hungary. Newman&apos;s mother (born TerÃ©zia FeckovÃ¡, daughter of Stefan Fecko and MÃ¡ria Polenak) was a Roman Catholic Slovak from Homonna, Pticie (former Austro-Hungarian Empire), who became a practicing Christian Scientist. She and her brother, Newman&apos;s uncle Joe, had an interest in the creative arts, and it rubbed off on him. He acted in grade school and high school plays. The Newmans were well-to-do and Paul Newman grew up in affluent Shaker Heights. Before he became an actor, Newman ran the family sporting goods store in Cleveland, Ohio.By 1950, the 25-year-old Newman had been kicked out of Ohio University, where he belonged to the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, for unruly behavior (denting the college president&apos;s car with a beer keg), served three years in the United States Navy during World War II as a radio operator, graduated from Ohio&apos;s Kenyon College, married his first wife, Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Witte (born 1929), and had his first child, Scott. That same year, his father died. When he became successful in later years, Newman said if he had any regrets it would be that his father was not around to witness his success. He brought Jackie back to Shaker Heights and he ran his father&apos;s store for a short period. Then, knowing that wasn&apos;t the career path he wanted to take, he moved Jackie and Scott to New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended Yale University&apos;s School of Drama.While doing a play there, Newman was spotted by two agents, who invited him to come to New York City to pursue a career as a professional actor. After moving to New York, he acted in guest spots for various television series and in 1953 came a big break. He got the part of understudy of the lead role in the successful Broadway play &quot;Picnic&quot;. Through this play, he met actress Joanne Woodward (born 1930), who was also an understudy in the play. While they got on very well and there was a strong attraction, Newman was married and his second child, Susan, was born that year. During this time, Newman was accepted into the much admired and popular New York Actors Studio, although he did not actually audition.In 1954, a film Newman was very reluctant to do was released, Il calice d&apos;argento (1954). He considered his performance in this costume epic to be so bad that he took out a full-page ad in a trade paper apologizing for it to anyone who might have seen it. He had always been embarrassed about the film and reveled in making fun of it. He immediately wanted to return to the stage, and performed in &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;. In 1956, he got the chance to redeem himself in the film world by portraying boxer Rocky Graziano in LassÃ¹ qualcuno mi ama (1956), and critics praised his performance. In 1957, with a handful of films to his credit, he was cast in La lunga estate calda (1958), co-starring Joanne Woodward.During the shooting of this film, they realized they were meant to be together and by now, so did his then-wife Jackie, who gave Newman a divorce. He and Woodward wed in Las Vegas in January 1958. They went on to have three daughters together and raised them in Westport, Connecticut. In 1959, Newman received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, in La gatta sul tetto che scotta (1958). The 1960s would bring Newman into superstar status, as he became one of the most popular actors of the decade, and garnered three more Best Actor Oscar nominations, for Lo spaccone (1961), Hud il selvaggio (1963) and Nick mano fredda (1967). In 1968, his debut directorial effort La prima volta di Jennifer (1968) was given good marks, and although the film and Woodward were nominated for Oscars, Newman was not nominated for Best Director. However, he did win a Golden Globe Award for his direction.1969 brought the popular screen duo of Newman and Robert Redford together for the first time when Butch Cassidy (1969) was released. It was a box office smash. Through the 1970s, Newman had hits and misses from such popular films as La stangata (1973) and L&apos;inferno di cristallo (1974) to lesser known films as L&apos;uomo dai 7 capestri (1972) to a cult classic Colpo secco (1977). After the death of his only son, Scott, in 1978, Newman&apos;s personal life and film choices moved in a different direction. His acting work in the 1980s and on is what is often most praised by critics today. He became more at ease with himself and it was evident in Il verdetto (1982) for which he received his sixth Best Actor Oscar nomination and, in 1987, finally received his first Oscar for Il colore dei soldi (1986), almost thirty years after Woodward had won hers. Friend and director of LassÃ¹ qualcuno mi ama (1956), Robert Wise accepted the award on Newman&apos;s behalf as the actor did not attend the ceremony.Films were not the only thing on his mind during this period. A passionate race car driver since the early 1970s (despite being color-blind), he was co-founder of Newman-Haas racing in 1982, and also founded &quot;Newman&apos;s Own&quot;, a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which Newman donated to charity. He also started The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, an organization for children with serious illness. He was as well known for his philanthropic ways and highly successful business ventures as he was for his legendary actor status.Newman&apos;s marriage to Woodward lasted a half-century. Connecticut was their primary residence after leaving Hollywood and moving East in 1960. Renowned for his sense of humor, in 1998 he quipped that he was a little embarrassed to see his salad dressing grossing more than his movies. During his later years, he still attended races, was much involved in his charitable organizations, and in 2006, he opened a restaurant called Dressing Room, which helps out the Westport Country Playhouse, a place in which Newman took great pride. In 2007, while the public was largely unaware of the serious illness from which he was suffering, Newman made some headlines when he said he was losing his invention and confidence in his acting abilities and that acting was &quot;pretty much a closed book for me&quot;. A smoker for many years, Newman died on September 26, 2008, aged 83, from lung cancer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James David Graham Niven was born on the feast day of St David, patron Saint of Wales. Although registered as the son of his mother&apos;s husband (William Edward Graham Niven), he was, in fact, the result of one of the many extra-marital flings she enjoyed while her husband was off fighting in the First World War. Following Niven senior&apos;s death at Turkey&apos;s infamous Suvla Bay, Niven&apos;s mother went on to marry his biological father, the Conservative politician Sir Thomas Comyn-Platt, but it was years before the true father/son relationship was acknowledged.David Niven attended Stowe School and Sandhurst Military Academy and served for two years in Malta with the Highland Light Infantry. At the outbreak of World War II, although a top-line star, he re-joined the army (Rifle Brigade). He did agreed to appear in two films during the war, both of strong propaganda value (Il primo dei pochi (1942) and La via della gloria (1944)).Despite six years&apos; virtual absence from the screen, he came in second in the 1945 Popularity Poll of British film stars. Upon his return to Hollywood after the war he was made a Legionnaire of the Order of Merit (the highest U.S. order that can be awarded to a non-citizen), which was presented to Lt. Col. Niven by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In America, the early performing arts accomplishments of young Maureen FitzSimons (who we know as Maureen O&apos;Hara) would definitely have put her in the child prodigy category. However, for a child of Irish heritage surrounded by gifted parents and family, these were very natural traits. Maureen made her entrance into this caring haven on August 17, 1920, in Ranelagh (a suburb of Dublin), Ireland. Her mother, Marguerita Lilburn FitzSimons, was an accomplished contralto. Her father, Charles FitzSimons, managed a business in Dublin and also owned part of the renowned Irish soccer team &quot;The Shamrock Rovers&quot;. Maureen was the second of six FitzSimons children - Peggy, Florrie, Charles B. Fitzsimons, Margot Fitzsimons and James O&apos;Hara completed this beautiful family.Maureen loved playing rough athletic games as a child and excelled in sports. She combined this interest with an equally natural gift for performing. This was demonstrated by her winning pretty much every Feis award for drama and theatrical performing her country offered. By age 14 she was accepted to the prestigious Abbey Theater and pursued her dream of classical theater and operatic singing. This course was to be altered, however, when Charles Laughton, after seeing a screen test of Maureen, became mesmerized by her hauntingly beautiful eyes. Before casting her to star in La taverna della Giamaica (1939), Laughton and his partner, Erich Pommer, changed her name from Maureen FitzSimons to &quot;Maureen O&apos;Hara&quot; - a bit shorter last name for the marquee.Under contract to Laughton, Maureen&apos;s next picture was to be filmed in America (Notre Dame (1939)) at RKO Pictures. The epic film was an extraordinary success and Maureen&apos;s contract was eventually bought from Laughton by RKO. At 19, Maureen had already starred in two major motion pictures with Laughton. Unlike most stars of her era, she started at the top, and remained there - with her skills and talents only getting better and better with the passing years.Maureen has an enviable string of all-time classics to her credit that include the aforementioned &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, Com&apos;era verde la mia valle (1941), Il miracolo della 34Âª strada (1947), Governante rubacuori (1948), Un uomo tranquillo (1952), Il cowboy con il velo da sposa (1961) and McLintock (1963). Add to this the distinction of being voted one of the five most beautiful women in the world and you have a film star who was as gorgeous as she was talented.Although at times early in her career Hollywood didn&apos;t seem to notice, there was much more to Maureen O&apos;Hara than her dynamic beauty. She not only had a wonderful lyric soprano voice, but she could use her inherent athletic ability to perform physical feats that most actresses couldn&apos;t begin to attempt, from fencing to fisticuffs. She was a natural athlete.In her career Maureen starred with some of Hollywood&apos;s most dashing leading men, including Tyrone Power, John Payne, Rex Harrison, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Brian Keith, Sir Alec Guinness and, of course, her famed pairings with &quot;The Duke&quot; himself, John Wayne. She starred in five films with Wayne, the most beloved being Un uomo tranquillo (1952).In addition to famed director John Ford, Maureen was also fortunate to have worked for some other great directors in the business: Alfred Hitchcock, William Dieterle, Henry Hathaway, Henry King, Jean Renoir, John M. Stahl, William A. Wellman, Frank Borzage, Walter Lang, George Seaton, George Sherman, Carol Reed, Delmer Daves, David Swift, Andrew V. McLaglen and Chris Columbus.In 1968 Maureen found much deserved personal happiness when she married Charles Blair. Gen. Blair was a famous aviator whom she had known as a friend of her family for many years. A new career began for Maureen, that of a full-time wife. Her marriage to Blair, however, was again far from typical. Blair was the real-life version of what John Wayne had been on the screen. He had been a Brigadier General in the Air Force, a Senior Pilot with Pan American, and held many incredible record-breaking aeronautic achievements. Maureen happily retired from films in 1973 after making the TV movie The Red Pony (1973) (which won the prestigious Peabody Award for Excellence) with Henry Fonda. With Blair, Maureen managed Antilles Airboats, a commuter sea plane service in the Caribbean. She not only made trips around the world with her pilot husband, but owned and published a magazine, &quot;The Virgin Islander&quot;, writing a monthly column called &quot;Maureen O&apos;Hara Says&quot;.Tragically, Charles Blair died in a plane crash in 1978. Though completely devastated, Maureen pulled herself together and, with memories of ten of the happiest years of her life, continued on. She was elected President and CEO of Antilles Airboats, which brought her the distinction of being the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the United States.Fortunately, she was coaxed out of retirement several times - once in 1991 to star with John Candy in Cara mamma, mi sposo (1991) and again, in 1995, in a made-for-TV movie, The Christmas Box (1995) on CBS. In the spring of 1998, Maureen accepted the second of what would be three projects for Polson Productions and CBS: A spasso con Katherine (1998) - and, in October, 2000, The Last Dance (2000).On November 4, 2014 Maureen was honored by a long overdue Oscar for &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; at the annual Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Governors Awards.Maureen O&apos;Hara was absolutely stunning, with that trademark red hair, dazzling smile and those huge, expressive eyes. She has fans from all over the world of all ages who are utterly devoted to her legacy of films and her persona as a strong, courageous and intelligent woman.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1907-05-22</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Laurence Olivier could speak William Shakespeare&apos;s lines as naturally as if he were &quot;actually thinking them&quot;, said English playwright Charles Bennett, who met Olivier in 1927. Laurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, England, to Agnes Louise (Crookenden) and Gerard Kerr Olivier, a High Anglican priest. His surname came from a great-great-grandfather who was of French Huguenot origin.One of Olivier&apos;s earliest successes as a Shakespearean actor on the London stage came in 1935 when he played &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;Mercutio&quot; in alternate performances of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with John Gielgud. A young Englishwoman just beginning her career on the stage fell in love with Olivier&apos;s Romeo. In 1937, she was &quot;Ophelia&quot; to his &quot;Hamlet&quot; in a special performance at Kronberg Castle, Elsinore, Denmark. In 1940, she became his second wife after both returned from making films in America that were major box office hits of 1939. His film was Cime tempestose (1939), her film was Via col vento (1939). Vivien Leigh and Olivier were screen lovers in Elisabetta d&apos;inghilterra (1937), FatalitÃ  (1940) and Il grande ammiraglio (1941).There was almost a fourth film together in 1944 when Olivier and Leigh traveled to Scotland with Charles C. Bennett to research the real-life story of a Scottish girl accused of murdering her French lover. Bennett recalled that Olivier researched the story &quot;with all the thoroughness of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;we unearthed evidence, never known or produced at the trial, that would most certainly have sent the young lady to the gallows&quot;. The film project was then abandoned. During their two-decade marriage, Olivier and Leigh appeared on the stage in England and America and made films whenever they really needed to make some money.In 1951, Olivier was working on a screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser&apos;s novel &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; (Gli occhi che non sorrisero (1952)) while Leigh was completing work on the film version of the Tennessee Williams&apos; play, Un tram che si chiama Desiderio (1951). She won her second Oscar for bringing &quot;Blanche DuBois&quot; to the screen. Gli occhi che non sorrisero (1952) was a film that Olivier never talked about. George Hurstwood, a middle-aged married man from Chicago who tricked a young woman into leaving a younger man about to marry her, became a New York street person in the novel. Olivier played him as a somewhat nicer person who didn&apos;t fall quite as low. A PBS documentary on Olivier&apos;s career broadcast in 1987 covered his first sojourn in Hollywood in the early 1930s with his first wife, Jill Esmond, and noted that her star was higher than his at that time. On film, he was upstaged by his second wife, too, even though the list of films he made is four times as long as hers.More than half of his film credits come after Gli sfasati (1960), which started out as a play in London in 1957. When the play moved across the Atlantic to Broadway in 1958, the role of &quot;Archie Rice&quot;&apos;s daughter was taken over by Joan Plowright, who was also in the film. They married soon after the release of Gli sfasati (1960).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Eldred Gregory Peck was born on April 5, 1916 in La Jolla, California, to Bernice Mary (Ayres) and Gregory Pearl Peck, a chemist and druggist in San Diego. He had Irish (from his paternal grandmother), English, and some German, ancestry. His parents divorced when he was five years old. An only child, he was sent to live with his grandmother. He never felt he had a stable childhood. His fondest memories are of his grandmother taking him to the movies every week and of his dog, which followed him everywhere. He studied pre-med at UC-Berkeley and, while there, got bitten by the acting bug and decided to change the focus of his studies. He enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and debuted on Broadway after graduation. His debut was in Emlyn Williams&apos; play &quot;The Morning Star&quot; (1942). By 1943, he was in Hollywood, where he debuted in the RKO film Tamara figlia della steppa (1944).Stardom came with his next film, Le chiavi del paradiso (1944), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Peck&apos;s screen presence displayed the qualities for which he became well known. He was tall, rugged and heroic, with a basic decency that transcended his roles. He appeared in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Io ti salverÃ² (1945) as an amnesia victim accused of murder. In Il cucciolo (1946), he was again nominated for an Academy Award and won the Golden Globe. He was especially effective in westerns and appeared in such varied fare as David O. Selznick&apos;s critically blasted Duello al sole (1946), the somewhat better received Cielo giallo (1948) and the acclaimed Romantico avventuriero (1950). He was nominated again for the Academy Award for his roles in Barriera invisibile (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, and Cielo di fuoco (1949), a story of high-level stress in an Air Force bomber unit in World War II.With a string of hits to his credit, Peck made the decision to only work in films that interested him. He continued to appear as the heroic, larger-than-life figures in such films as Le avventure del capitano Hornblower (Il temerario) (1951) and Moby Dick - La balena bianca (1956). He worked with Audrey Hepburn in her debut film, Vacanze romane (1953). Peck finally won the Oscar, after four nominations, for his performance as lawyer Atticus Finch in Il buio oltre la siepe (1962). In the early 1960s, he appeared in two darker films than he usually made, Il promontorio della paura (1962) and Capitan Newman (1963), which dealt with the way people live. He also gave a powerful performance as Captain Keith Mallory in I cannoni di Navarone (1961), one of the biggest box-office hits of that year.In the early 1970s, he produced two films, The Trial of the Catonsville Nine (1972) and Il ragazzo del mare (1974), when his film career stalled. He made a comeback playing, somewhat woodenly, Robert Thorn in the horror film Il presagio (1976). After that, he returned to the bigger-than-life roles he was best known for, such as Mac Arthur il generale ribelle (1977) and the monstrous Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele in the huge hit I ragazzi venuti dal Brasile (1978). In the 1980s, he moved into television with the miniseries The Blue and the Gray (1982) and Scarlatto e nero (1983). In 1991, he appeared in the remake of his 1962 film, playing a different role, in Martin Scorsese&apos;s Cape Fear - Il promontorio della paura (1991). He was also cast as the progressive-thinking owner of a wire and cable business in I soldi degli altri (1991).In 1967, Peck received the Academy&apos;s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. He was also been awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom. Always politically progressive, he was active in such causes as anti-war protests, workers&apos; rights and civil rights. In 2003, his Peck&apos;s portrayal of Atticus Finch was named the greatest film hero of the past 100 years by the American Film Institute. Gregory Peck died at age 87 on June 12, 2003 in Los Angeles, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tyrone Power was one of the great romantic swashbuckling stars of the mid-twentieth century, and the third Tyrone Power of four in a famed acting dynasty reaching back to the eighteenth century. His great-grandfather was the first Tyrone Power (1795-1841), a famed Irish comedian. His father, known to historians as Tyrone Power Sr., but to his contemporaries as either Tyrone Power or Tyrone Power the Younger, was a huge star in the theater (and later in films) in both classical and modern roles. His mother, Helen Emma &quot;Patia&quot; (nÃ©e Reaume), (Mrs. Tyrone Power), was also a Shakespearean actress as well as a respected dramatic coach.Tyrone Edmund Power, Jr., (also called Tyrone Power III) was born at his mother&apos;s home of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, French Huguenot, and French-Canadian. A frail, sickly child, he was taken by his parents to the warmer climate of southern California. After his parents&apos; divorce, he and his sister Anne Power returned to Cincinnati with their mother. There he attended school while developing an obsession with acting. Although raised by his mother, he corresponded with his father, who encouraged his acting dreams. He was a supernumerary in his father&apos;s stage production of &apos;The Merchant of Venice&apos; in Chicago and held him as he died suddenly of a heart attack later that year.Startlingly handsome, young Tyrone nevertheless struggled to find work in Hollywood. He appeared in a few small roles, then went east to do stage work. A screen test led to a contract at 20th Century Fox in 1936, and he quickly progressed to leading roles. Within a year or so, he was one of Fox&apos;s leading stars, playing in contemporary and period pieces with ease. Most of his roles were colorful without being deep, and his swordplay was more praised than his wordplay. He served in the Marine Corps in World War II as a transport pilot, and he saw action in the Pacific Theater of operations.After the war, he got his best reviews for an atypical part as a downward-spiraling con-man in La fiera delle illusioni (1947). Although he remained a huge star, much of his postwar work was unremarkable. He continued to do notable stage work and also began producing films. Following a fine performance in Billy Wilder&apos;s Testimone d&apos;accusa (1957), Power began production on Salomone e la regina di Saba (1959). Halfway through shooting, he collapsed during a dueling scene with George Sanders, and he died of a heart attack before reaching a hospital.His three children, including his namesake, Tyrone William Power IV (known professionally as Tyrone Power Jr.), have all followed him in the family acting tradition.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Presley (nÃ©e Gladys Love Smith) and Vernon Presley (Vernon Elvis Presley). He had a twin brother who was stillborn. In 1948, Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee where he attended Humes High School. In 1953, he attended the senior prom with the current girl he was courting, Regis Wilson. After graduating from high school in Memphis, Elvis took odd jobs working as a movie theater usher and a truck driver for Crown Electric Company. He began singing locally as &quot;The Hillbilly Cat&quot;, then signed with a local recording company, and then with RCA in 1955.Elvis did much to establish early rock and roll music. He began his career as a performer of rockabilly, an up-tempo fusion of country music and rhythm and blues, with a strong backbeat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing &apos;black&apos; and &apos;white&apos; sounds, made him popular - and controversial - as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop music. Teenage girls became hysterical over his blatantly sexual gyrations, particularly the one that got him nicknamed &quot;Elvis the Pelvis&quot; (television cameras were not permitted to film below his waist).In 1956, following his six television appearances on The Dorsey Brothers&apos; &quot;Stage Show&quot;, Elvis was cast in his first acting role, in a supporting part in Fratelli rivali (1956), the first of 33 movies he starred in.In 1958, Elvis was drafted into the military, and relocated to Bad Nauheim, Germany. There he met 14-year old army damsel Priscilla Ann Wagner (Priscilla Presley), whom he would eventually marry after an eight-year courtship, and by whom he had his only child, Lisa Marie Presley. Elvis&apos; military service and the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the 1960s reduced his concerts, though not his movie/recording income.Through the 1960s, Elvis settled in Hollywood, where he starred in the majority of his thirty-three movies, mainly musicals, acting alongside some of the most well known actors in Hollywood. Critics panned most of his films, but they did very well at the box office, earning upwards of $150 million total. His last fiction film, Change of Habit (1969), deals with several social issues; romance within the clergy, an autistic child, almost unheard of in 1969, rape, and mob violence. It has recently received critical acclaim.Elvis made a comeback in the 1970s with live concert appearances starting in early 1970 in Las Vegas with over 57 sold-out shows. He toured throughout the United States, appearing on-stage in over 500 live appearances, many of them sold out shows. His marriage ended in divorce, and the stress of constantly traveling as well as his increasing weight gain and dependence upon stimulants and depressants took their toll.Elvis Presley died at age 42 on August 16, 1977 at his mansion in Graceland, near Memphis, shocking his fans worldwide. At the time of his death, he had sold more than 600 million singles and albums. Since his death, Graceland has become a shrine for millions of followers worldwide. Elvis impersonators and purported sightings have become stock subjects for humorists. To date, Elvis Presley is the only performer to have been inducted into three separate music &apos;Halls of Fame&apos;. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales, and remains one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Anthony Quinn was born Antonio Rudolfo Oaxaca Quinn on April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico, to Manuela (Oaxaca) and Francisco Quinn, who became an assistant cameraman at a Los Angeles (CA) film studio. His paternal grandfather was Irish, and the rest of his family was Mexican. After starting life in extremely modest circumstances in Mexico, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he grew up in the Boyle Heights and Echo Park neighborhoods. He attended Polytechnic High School and later Belmont High, but eventually dropped out. The young Quinn boxed (which stood him in good stead as a stage actor, when he played Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; to rave reviews in Chicago), then later studied architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright at the great architect&apos;s studio, Taliesin, in Arizona. Quinn was close to Wright, who encouraged him when he decided to give acting a try. After a brief apprenticeship on stage, Quinn hit Hollywood in 1936 and picked up a variety of small roles in several films at Paramount, including an Indian warrior in La conquista del West (1936), which was directed by the man who later became his father-in-law, Cecil B. DeMille.As a contract player at Paramount, Quinn mainly played villains and ethnic types, such as an Arab chieftain in the Bing Crosby-Bob Hope vehicle Avventura al Marocco (1942). As a Mexican national (he did not become an American citizen until 1947), he was exempt from the draft. With many actors in the service fighting World War II, Quinn was able to move up into better supporting roles. He had married DeMille&apos;s daughter Katherine DeMille, which afforded him entrance to the top circles of Hollywood society. He became disenchanted with his career and did not renew his Paramount contract despite the advice of others, including his father-in-law (whom Quinn felt never accepted him due to his Mexican roots). Instead, he returned to the stage to hone his craft. His portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in Chicago and on Broadway (where he replaced the legendary Marlon Brando, who is forever associated with the role) made his reputation and boosted his film career when he returned to the movies.Brando and Elia Kazan, who directed &quot;Streetcar&quot; on Broadway and on film (Un tram che si chiama Desiderio (1951)), were crucial to Quinn&apos;s future success. Kazan, knowing the two were potential rivals due to their acclaimed portrayals of Kowalski, cast Quinn as Brando&apos;s brother in his biographical film of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, Viva Zapata! (1952). Quinn won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for 1952, making him the first Mexican-American to win an Oscar. It was not to be his lone appearance in the winner&apos;s circle: he won his second Supporting Actor Oscar in 1957 for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli&apos;s biographical film of Vincent van Gogh, Brama di vivere (1956), opposite Kirk Douglas. Over the next decade Quinn lived in Italy and became a major figure in world cinema, as many studios shot films in Italy to take advantage of the lower costs (&quot;runaway production&quot; had battered the industry since its beginnings in the New York / New Jersey area in the 1910s). He appeared in several Italian films, giving one of his greatest performances as the circus strongman who brutalizes the sweet soul played by Giulietta Masina in her husband Federico Fellini&apos;s masterpiece La strada (1954).Alternating between Europe and Hollywood, Quinn built his reputation and entered the front rank of character actors and character leads. He received his third Oscar nomination (and first for Best Actor) for George Cukor&apos;s Selvaggio Ã¨ il vento (1957). He played a Greek resistance fighter against the Nazi occupation in the monster hit I cannoni di Navarone (1961) and received kudos for his portrayal of a once-great boxer on his way down in Rod Serling&apos;s Una faccia piena di pugni (1962). He went back to playing ethnic roles, such as an Arab warlord in David Lean&apos;s masterpiece Lawrence d&apos;Arabia (1962), and he played the eponymous lead in the &quot;sword-and-sandal&quot; blockbuster Barabba (1961). Two years later, he reached the zenith of his career, playing Zorba the Greek in the film of the same name (a.k.a. Zorba il greco (1964)), which brought him his fourth, and last, Oscar nomination as Best Actor. The 1960s were kind to him: he played character leads in such major films as The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) and Il segreto di Santa Vittoria (1969). However, his appearance in the title role in the film adaptation of John Fowles&apos; novel, Gioco perverso (1968), did nothing to save the film, which was one of that decade&apos;s notorious turkeys.In the 1960s, Quinn told Life magazine that he would fight against typecasting. Unfortunately, the following decade saw him slip back into playing ethnic types again, in such critical bombs as Il magnate greco (1978). He starred as the Hispanic mayor of a southwestern city on the short-lived television series Un uomo per la cittÃ  (1971), but his career lost its momentum during the 1970s. Aside from playing a thinly disguised Aristotle Onassis in the cinematic roman-a-clef Il magnate greco (1978), his other major roles of the decade were as Hamza in the controversial Il messaggio (1976) (a.k.a. &quot;Mohammad, Messenger of God&quot;), as the Italian patriarch in L&apos;ereditÃ  Ferramonti (1976), yet another Arab in Caravans (1978) and a Mexican patriarch in I figli di Sanchez (1978). In 1983, he reprised his most famous role, Zorba the Greek, on Broadway in the revival of the musical &quot;Zorba&quot;, for 362 performances. Though his film career slowed during the 1990s, he continued to work steadily in films and television.Quinn lived out the latter years of his life in Bristol, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his time painting and sculpting. He died in a hospital in Boston from pneumonia and respiratory failure linked to his battle with throat cancer. He was 86 years old.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emanuel Goldenberg arrived in the United States from Romania at age ten, and his family moved into New York&apos;s Lower East Side. He took up acting while attending City College, abandoning plans to become a rabbi or lawyer. The American Academy of Dramatic Arts awarded him a scholarship, and he began work in stock, with his new name, Edward G. Robinson (the &quot;G&quot; stood for his birth surname), in 1913. Broadway was two years later; he worked steadily there for 15 years. His work included &quot;The Kibitzer&quot;, a comedy he co-wrote with Jo Swerling. His film debut was a small supporting part in the silent The Bright Shawl (1923), but it was with the coming of sound that he hit his stride. His stellar performance as snarling, murderous thug Rico Bandello in Piccolo Cesare (1931)--all the more impressive since in real life Robinson was a sophisticated, cultured man with a passion for fine art--set the standard for movie gangsters, both for himself in many later films and for the industry. He portrayed the title character in several biographical works, such as Un uomo contro la morte (1940) and La vita di Giulio Reuter (1940). Psychological dramas included Il carnevale della vita (1943), La fiamma del peccato (1944), La donna del ritratto (1944)and La strada scarlatta (1945). Another notable gangster role was in L&apos;isola di corallo (1948). He was &quot;absolved&quot; of allegations of Communist affiliation after testifying as a friendly witness for the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy hysteria of the early 1950s. In 1956 he had to sell off his extensive art collection in a divorce settlement and also had to deal with a psychologically troubled son. In 1956 he returned to Broadway in &quot;Middle of the Night&quot;. In 1973 he was awarded a special, posthumous Oscar for lifetime achievement.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in Milan in 1911 into a family of musicians, Nino Rota was first a student of Orefice and Pizzetti. Then, still a child, he moved to Rome where he completed his studies at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1929 with Alfredo Casella. In the meantime, he had become an &apos;enfant prodige&apos;, famous both as a composer and as an orchestra conductor. His first oratorio, &quot;L&apos;infanzia di San Giovanni Battista,&quot; was performed in Milan and Paris as early as 1923 and his lyrical comedy, &quot;Il Principe Porcaro,&quot; was composed in 1926. From 1930 to 1932, Nino Rota lived in the USA. He won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Philadelphia where he attended classes in composition taught by Rosario Scalero and classes in orchestra taught by Fritz Reiner. He returned to Italy and earned a degree in literature from the University of Milan. In 1937, he began a teaching career that led to the directorship of the Bari Conservatory, a title he held from 1950 until his death in 1979. After his &quot;childhood&quot; compositions, Nino Rota wrote the following operas: Ariodante (Parma 1942), Torquemada (1943), Il cappello di paglia di Firenze (Palermo 1955), I due timidi (RAI 1950, London 1953), La notte di un neurastenico (Premio Italia 1959, La Scala 1960), Lo scoiattolo in gamba (Venezia 1959), Aladino e la lampada magica (Naples 1968), La visita meravigliosa (Palermo 1970), Napoli milionaria (Spoleto Festival 1977). He also wrote the following ballets: La rappresentazione di Adamo ed Eva (Perugia 1957), La Strada (La Scala 1965), Aci e Galatea (Rome 1971), Le MoliÃ¨re imaginaire (Paris and Brussels 1976) and Amor di poeta (Brussels 1978) for Maurice BÃ©jart. In addition, there are countless works for orchestra that have been performed since before World War II and are still performed by orchestras in every part of the world. His work in film dates back to the early forties. His filmography includes the names of virtually all of the noted directors of his time. First among these is Federico Fellini. He wrote all of the movie scores for Fellini&apos;s films from Lo sceicco bianco (1952) in 1952 to Prova d&apos;orchestra (1978) in 1978. Other directors include Renato Castellani, Luchino Visconti, Franco Zeffirelli, Mario Monicelli, Francis Ford Coppola (Oscar for best original score for Il padrino - Parte II (1974)), King Vidor, RenÃ© ClÃ©ment, Edward Dmytryk, and &apos;Eduardo de Filippo&apos;. He also composed the music for many theatre productions by Visconti, Zefirelli, and de Filippo. In February of 1995, the Nino Rota Foundation was established at Fondazione Cini of Venice, Italy. Cini specializes in the works of 20th century Italian composers and includes the estate of Casella.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ernestine Jane Geraldine Russell was born on June 21, 1921 in Bemidji, Minnesota. Her father was a United States Army lieutenant and her mother had been a student of drama and an actress with a traveling troupe. Once Mr. Russell was mustered out of the service, the family took up residence in Canada, but moved to California when he found employment there. The family was well-to-do and although Jane was the only girl among four brothers, her mother saw to it that she took piano lessons. In addition to music, Jane was interested in drama much as her mother had been and participated in high school stage productions. Upon graduation, Jane took a job as a receptionist for a doctor who specialized in foot disorders. Although she had originally planned on being a designer, her father died and she had to go to work to help the family. Jane modeled on the side and was very much sought-after especially because of her figure.She managed to save enough money to go to drama school, with the urging of her mother. She was ultimately signed by Howard Hughes for his production of Il mio corpo ti scalderÃ  (1943) in 1941, the film that was to make Jane famous. The film was not a classic by any means, but was geared to show off Jane&apos;s ample physical assets. Although the film was made in 1941, it was not released until two years later and then only on a limited basis due to the way the film portrayed Jane&apos;s assets. It was hard for the flick to pass the censorship board. Finally, the film gained general release in 1946. The film was a smash at the box-office.Jane did not make another film until 1946 when she played Joan Kenwood in Una giovane vedova (1946). She had signed a seven year contract with Hughes and it seemed the only films he would put her in were those that displayed Jane in a very flattering light due to her body. Films such as Il suo tipo di donna (1951) and La cittÃ  del piacere (1952) did nothing to showcase her true acting abilities. Probably the pinnacle of her career was in Gli uomini preferiscono le bionde (1953) as Dorothy Shaw, with Marilyn Monroe. This film showed Jane&apos;s comedic side very well. Jane did continue to make films throughout the 1950s, but the films were at times not up to par, particularly with Jane&apos;s talents being wasted in forgettable movies in order to show off her sexy side. Films such as Gli uomini sposano le brune (1955) and Femmina ribelle (1956) did do Jane justice and were able to show exactly the fine actress she was.After Vietato rubare le stelle (1957) (a flop), Jane took a hiatus from films, to dabble a little in television, returning in 1964 to film Destino in agguato (1964). Unfortunately, the roles were not there anymore as Jane appeared in only four pictures during the entire decade of the 1960s. Her last film of the decade was Violence (1967). After three more years away from the big screen, she returned to make one last film called Grande caldo per il racket della droga (1970). Her last play before the public was in the 1970s when Jane was a spokesperson for Playtex bras. Had Jane not been wasted during the Hughes years, she could have been a bigger actress than what she was allowed to show. Jane Russell died at age 89 of respiratory failure on February 28, 2011 in Santa Maria, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A child prodigy, Miklos RÃ³zsa learned to play the violin at the age of five and read music before he was able to read words. In 1926, he began studying at the Leipzig Conservatory where he was considered a brilliant student. He obtained his doctorate in music in 1930. Moving to Paris the following year, RÃ³zsa had much of his own chamber music performed, as well as his &apos;Variations on a Hungarian Peasant Song&apos; and his &apos;Symphony and Serenade for Small Orchestra&apos;. However, he soon became disenchanted with meagre wages for playing classical music in concert. Attempting to change his financial situation, RÃ³zsa managed to secure a contract with Pathe records to compose music for use in intermissions between movies. This was to be his first step in entering the more lucrative field of film composition. In 1935, RÃ³zsa went to London after being invited by the Hungarian Legation to write the music for a ballet. The resulting work, &apos;Hungaria&apos;, so impressed the director Jacques Feyder that he set up a meeting with fellow Hungarian Alexander Korda, who then commissioned him to write an opulent score for the romantic drama La contessa Alessandra (1937). RÃ³zsa later recalled having to learn to write music for films &apos;the hard way&apos;: &quot;I bought one German and one Russian book on the technique of film music and everything I learned from these books was absolutely wrong! But then I had long conferences with Muir Mathieson, who was the music director and conductor for Korda, and somehow I learned.&quot;While writing the score for Il ladro di Bagdad (1940), RÃ³zsa relocated to Hollywood where he remained gainfully employed over the next four decades. An expert at orchestration and counterpoint with a great flair for the dramatic, he often concentrated on the psychological aspects of a film. One of his innovations was the use of a theremin for the famous dream sequence in Io ti salverÃ² (1945) which accompanies Salvador DalÃ­&apos;s transcendental nightmare images. Few composers have managed to convey suspense and tension as powerfully as RÃ³zsa with his eerily haunting scores for some of the Golden Era&apos;s best films noir (La fiamma del peccato (1944), Lo strano amore di Marta Ivers (1946), I gangsters (1946), La cittÃ  nuda (1948)) or his lush, stirring music for spectacular epics (Quo Vadis (1951), Ivanhoe (1952), El Cid (1961)). In addition to winning three Oscars for his film work, RÃ³zsa also continued as a prolific composer of classical music, including Violin and Piano Concertos, a Concerto for String Orchestra, a Sinfonia Concertante and Notturno Ungherese (influenced, respectively, by Stravinsky and BartÃ³k). In 1945, he was appointed Professor of Composition at the University of Southern California where also lectured on the subject for many years.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Handsome American leading man who developed into one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest and most popular Western stars. Born to George and Lucy Crane Scott during a visit to Virginia, Scott was raised in Charlotte, North Carolina in a wealthy family. After service with the U.S. Army in France in World War I, he attended Georgia Institute of Technology but, after being injured playing football, transferred to the University of North Carolina, from which he graduated with a degree in textile engineering and manufacturing. He discovered acting and went to California, where he met Howard Hughes, who obtained an audition for him for Cecil B. DeMille&apos;s Dinamite (1929), a role which went instead to Joel McCrea. He was hired to coach Gary Cooper in a Virginia dialect for L&apos;uomo della Virginia (1929) and played a bit part in the film. Paramount scouts saw him in a play and offered him a contract. He met Cary Grant, another Paramount contract player, on the set of Hot Saturday (1932) and the pair soon moved in together. Their on-and-off living arrangement would last until 1942. Scott married and divorced wealthy heiress Marion DuPont in the late 1930&apos;s. He moved into leading roles at Paramount, although his easy-going charm was not enough to indicate the tremendous success that would come to him later. He was a pleasant figure in comedies, dramas and the occasional adventure, but it was not until he began focusing on Westerns in the late 1940s that he reached his greatest stardom. His screen persona altered into that of a stoic, craggy, and uncompromising figure, a tough, hard-bitten man seemingly unconnected to the light comedy lead he had been in the 1930s. He became one of the top box office stars of the 1950s and, in the Westerns of Budd Boetticher especially, a critically important figure in the Western as an art form. Following a critically acclaimed, less-heroic-than-usual role in one of the classics of the genre, Sfida nell&apos;alta Sierra (1962), Scott retired from films. A multimillionaire as a result of canny investments, Scott spent his remaining years playing golf and avoiding film industry affairs, stating that he didn&apos;t like publicity. He died in 1987 survived by his second wife, Patricia Stillman, and his two adopted children, Christopher and Sandra. He is buried in Charlotte, North Carolina.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1915-12-12</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Frank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants Natalina Della (Garaventa), from Northern Italy, and Saverio Antonino Martino Sinatra, a Sicilian boxer, fireman, and bar owner. Growing up on the gritty streets of Hoboken made Sinatra determined to work hard to get ahead. Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives (he carried his own P.A. system), he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with Harry James and then Tommy Dorsey. With the help of George Evans (Sinatra&apos;s genius press agent), his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra. In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxers--the young women and girls who were his fans--and becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck box-office gold with a lead role in Due marinai e una ragazza (1945) with Gene Kelly, a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, The House I Live In (1945). His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical Un giorno a New York (1949) and Facciamo il tifo insieme (1949). A controversial public affair with screen siren Ava Gardner broke up his marriage to Nancy Barbato Sinatra and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as Lasciami sognare (1952), and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wanted--Maggio in Da qui all&apos;eternitÃ  (1953). He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a cold-blooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Gangsters in agguato (1954). Arguably a career-best performance--garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor--was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama L&apos;uomo dal braccio d&apos;oro (1955).Known as &quot;One-Take Charlie&quot; for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Bulli e pupe (1955), Il Jolly Ã¨ impazzito (1957) and Qualcuno verrÃ  (1958). In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as Un uomo da vendere (1959), Tre contro tutti (1962) and the very successful I 4 di Chicago (1964). Lighter roles alongside &quot;Rat Pack&quot; buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative, especially the famed Colpo grosso (1960). On the other hand, he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings, such as Va&apos; e uccidi (1962), regarded by many critics as Sinatra&apos;s finest picture. He made his directorial debut with the World War II picture La tua pelle o la mia (1965), which was the first Japanese/American co-production. That same year Il colonnello Von Ryan (1965) was a box office sensation. In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in Sidney J. Furie&apos;s Colpo su colpo (1967), once again playing as assassin in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany. That same year he starred as a private investigator in L&apos;investigatore (1967), a role he reprised in the sequel, La signora nel cemento (1968). He also starred with Lee Remick in Inchiesta pericolosa (1968), a film daring for its time with its theme of murders involving rich and powerful homosexual men, and it was a major box-office success.After appearing in the poorly received comic western Dingus, quello sporco individuo (1970), Sinatra didn&apos;t act again for seven years, returning with a made-for-TV cops-and-mob-guys thriller Contract on Cherry Street (1977), which he also produced. Based on the novel by William Rosenberg, this fable of fed-up cops turning vigilante against the mob boasted a stellar cast and was a ratings success. Sinatra returned to the big screen in Delitti inutili (1980), once again playing a New York detective, in a moving and understated performance that was a fitting coda to his career as a leading man. He made one more appearance on the big screen with a cameo in La corsa piÃ¹ pazza d&apos;America n. 2 (1984) and a final acting performance in Magnum P.I. (1980), in 1987, as a retired police detective seeking vengeance on the killers of his granddaughter, in an episode entitled Magnum P.I.: Laura (1987).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Austrian composer Max Steiner achieved legendary status as the creator of hundreds of classic American film scores. He was born Maximilian Raoul Walter Steiner in Vienna, Austria, the son of Marie Mizzi (Hasiba) and Gabor Steiner, an impresario, and the grandson of actor and theater director and manager Maximilian Steiner. His family was Jewish. As a child, he was astonishingly musically gifted, composing complex works as a teenager and completing the course of study at Vienna&apos;s Hochschule fuer Musik und Darstellende Kunst in only one year, at the age of sixteen. He studied under Gustav Mahler and, before the age of twenty, made his living as a conductor and as composer of works for the theater, the concert hall, and vaudeville. After a brief sojourn in Britian, Steiner moved to the USA in the same wave as fellow film composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold and quickly became a sought-after orchestrator and conductor on Broadway, bringing the Western classical tradition in which he had been raised to mainstream audiences.He was soon snatched up by the film studios with the advent of sound and helped the fledgling talkies become musically sophisticated within a brief few years. He was one of the first to fully integrate the musical score with the images on-screen and to score individual scenes for their content and create leitmotifs for individual characters, as opposed to simply providing vaguely appropriate mood music, as evidenced in King Kong (1933), which set the standard for American film music for years to come.From the 1930s to the 1960s, he was one of the most respected, innovative, and brilliant composers of American film music, creating a truly staggering number of exceptional scores for films of all types. He was nominated for Academy Awards for his scores eighteen times and won three times. Years after his death in 1971, he remains one of the giants of motion picture history, and his music still thrives.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908 in Indiana, Pennsylvania, to Elizabeth Ruth (Johnson) and Alexander Maitland Stewart, who owned a hardware store. He was of Scottish, Ulster-Scots, and some English, descent. Stewart was educated at a local prep school, Mercersburg Academy, where he was a keen athlete (football and track), musician (singing and accordion playing), and sometime actor.In 1929, he won a place at Princeton University, where he studied architecture with some success and became further involved with the performing arts as a musician and actor with the University Players. After graduation, engagements with the University Players took him around the northeastern United States, including a run on Broadway in 1932. But work dried up as the Great Depression deepened, and it was not until 1934, when he followed his friend Henry Fonda to Hollywood, that things began to pick up.After his first screen appearance in Art Trouble (1934), he worked for a time for MGM as a contract player and slowly began making a name for himself in increasingly high-profile roles throughout the rest of the 1930s. His famous collaborations with Frank Capra, in L&apos;eterna illusione (1938), Mr. Smith va a Washington (1939), and, after World War II, La vita Ã¨ meravigliosa (1946) helped to launch his career as a star and to establish his screen persona as the likable &quot;every man&quot;.Having learned to fly in 1935, he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940 as a private (after twice failing the medical for being underweight). During the course of World War II he rose to the rank of colonel, first as an instructor at home in the United States, and later on combat missions in Europe. He remained involved with the United States Air Force Reserve after the war and retired in 1959 as a brigadier general.Stewart&apos;s acting career took off properly after the war. During the course of his long professional life, he had roles in some of Hollywood&apos;s best-remembered films, starring in a string of Westerns, bringing his &quot;every man&quot; qualities to movies like L&apos;uomo che uccise Liberty Valance (1962)), biopics (Il ritorno del campione (1949), La storia di Glenn Miller (1954), and L&apos;aquila solitaria (1957), for instance, thrillers (most notably his frequent collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock) and even some screwball comedies.On June 25, 1997, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism, and a week later on July 2, 1997, surrounded by his children, James Stewart died at age 89 at his home in Beverly Hills, California. His last words to his family were, &quot;I&apos;m going to be with Gloria now&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor was considered one of the last, if not the last, major star to have come out of the old Hollywood studio system. She was known internationally for her beauty, especially for her violet eyes, with which she captured audiences early on in her youth and kept the world hooked on with since.Taylor was born on February 27, 1932 in London, England. Although she was born an English subject, her parents, Sara Sothern (nÃ©e Sara Viola Warmbrodt) and Francis Lenn Taylor, were Americans, art dealers from St. Louis, Missouri (her father had gone to London to set up a gallery). Her mother had been an actress on the stage, but gave up that vocation when she married. Elizabeth lived in London until the age of seven, when the family left for the US when the clouds of war began brewing in Europe in 1939. They sailed without her father, who stayed behind to wrap up the loose ends of the art business.The family relocated to Los Angeles, where Mrs. Taylor&apos;s own family had moved. Mr. Taylor followed not long afterward. A family friend noticed the strikingly beautiful little Elizabeth and suggested that she be taken for a screen test. Her test impressed executives at Universal Pictures enough to sign her to a contract. Her first foray onto the screen was in There&apos;s One Born Every Minute (1942), released when she was ten. Universal dropped her contract after that one film, but Elizabeth was soon picked up by MGM.The first production she made with that studio was Torna a casa Lassie! (1943), and on the strength of that one film, MGM signed her for a full year. She had minuscule parts in her next two films, Le bianche scogliere di Dover (1944) and La porta proibita (1943) (the former made while she was on loan to 20th Century-Fox). Then came the picture that made Elizabeth a star: MGM&apos;s Gran premio (1944). She played Velvet Brown opposite Mickey Rooney. The film was a smash hit, grossing over $4 million. Elizabeth now had a long-term contract with MGM and was its top child star. She made no films in 1945, but returned in 1946 in Il coraggio di Lassie (1946), another success. In 1947, when she was 15, she starred in Vita col padre (1947) with such heavyweights as William Powell, Irene Dunne and Zasu Pitts, which was one of the biggest box office hits of the year. She also co-starred in the ensemble film Piccole donne (1949), which was also a box office huge success.Throughout the 1950s, Elizabeth appeared in film after film with mostly good results, starting with her role in the George Stevens film Un posto al sole (1951), co-starring her good friend Montgomery Clift. The following year, she co-starred in Ivanhoe (1952), one of the biggest box office hits of the year. Her busiest year was 1954. She had a supporting role in the box office flop Lord Brummell (1954), but later that year starred in the hits L&apos;ultima volta che vidi Parigi (1954) and La pista degli elefanti (1953). She was 22 now, and even at that young age was considered one of the world&apos;s great beauties. In 1955 she appeared in the hit Il gigante (1956) with James Dean.Sadly, Dean never saw the release of the film, as he died in a car accident in 1955. The next year saw Elizabeth co-star with Montgomery Clift in L&apos;albero della vita (1957), an overblown epic made, partially, in Kentucky. Critics called it dry as dust. In addition, Clift was seriously injured during the film, with Taylor helping save his life. Despite the film&apos;s shortcomings and off-camera tragedy, Elizabeth was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Southern belle Susanna Drake. However, on Oscar night the honor went to Joanne Woodward for La donna dai 3 volti (1957).In 1958 Elizabeth starred as Maggie Pollitt in La gatta sul tetto che scotta (1958). The film received rave reviews from the critics and Elizabeth was nominated again for an Academy Award for best actress, but this time she lost to Susan Hayward in Non voglio morire (1958). She was still a hot commodity in the film world, though. In 1959 she appeared in another mega-hit and received yet another Oscar nomination for Improvvisamente, l&apos;estate scorsa (1959). Once again, however, she lost out, this time to Simone Signoret for La strada dei quartieri alti (1959). Her Oscar drought ended in 1960 when she brought home the coveted statue for her performance in Venere in visone (1960) as Gloria Wandrous, a call girl who is involved with a married man. Some critics blasted the movie but they couldn&apos;t ignore her performance. There were no more films for Elizabeth for three years. She left MGM after her contract ran out, but would do projects for the studio later down the road. In 1963 she starred in Cleopatra (1963), which was one of the most expensive productions up to that time--as was her salary, a whopping $1,000,000. The film took years to complete, due in part to a serious illness during which she nearly died.This was the film where she met her future and fifth husband, Richard Burton (the previous four were Conrad Hilton, Michael Wilding, Mike Todd--who died in a plane crash--and Eddie Fisher). Her next films, International Hotel (1963) and Castelli di sabbia (1965), were lackluster at best. Elizabeth was to return to fine form, however, with the role of Martha in Chi ha paura di Virginia Woolf? (1966). Her performance as the loudmouthed, shrewish, unkempt, yet still alluring Martha was easily her finest to date. For this she would win her second Oscar and one that was more than well-deserved. The following year, she and Burton co-starred in La bisbetica domata (1967), again giving winning performances. However, her films afterward were box office failures, including Riflessi in un occhio d&apos;oro (1967), I commedianti (1967) La scogliera dei desideri (1968) (again co-starring with Burton), Cerimonia segreta (1968), L&apos;unico gioco in cittÃ  (1970), X Y e Zi (1972), Una faccia di c... (1972) (with Burton again), MercoledÃ¬ delle ceneri (1973), Ad un&apos;ora della notte (1973), Identikit (1974), Il giardino della felicitÃ  (1976) (considered by many to be her worst), A Little Night Music (1977), and Rebus per un assassinio (1979) (a controversial film which was never given a full release and in which she only had a small role). Since then, she has appeared in some movies, both theatrical and made-for-television, and a number of television programs. In February 1997, Elizabeth entered the hospital for the removal of a brain tumor. The operation was successful. As for her private life, she divorced Burton in 1974, only to remarry him in 1975 and divorce him, permanently, in 1976. She had two more husbands, U.S. Senator John Warner and construction worker Larry Fortensky, whom she met in rehab.In 1959, Taylor converted to Judaism, and continued to identify herself as Jewish throughout her life, being active in Jewish causes. Upon the death of her friend, actor Rock Hudson, in 1985, she began her crusade on the behalf of AIDS sufferers. In the 1990s, she also developed a successful series of scents. In her later years, her acting career was relegated to the occasional TV-movie or TV guest appearance.Elizabeth Taylor died on March 23, 2011 in Los Angeles, from congestive heart failure. Her final resting place is Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Shirley Temple was easily the most popular and famous child star of all time. She got her start in the movies at the age of three and soon progressed to super stardom. Shirley could do it all: act, sing and dance and all at the age of five! Fans loved her as she was bright, bouncy and cheerful in her films and they ultimately bought millions of dollars&apos; worth of products that had her likeness on them. Dolls, phonograph records, mugs, hats, dresses, whatever it was, if it had her picture on there they bought it. Shirley was box-office champion for the consecutive years 1935-36-37-38, beating out such great grown-up stars as Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Robert Taylor, Gary Cooper and Joan Crawford. By 1939, her popularity declined. Although she starred in some very good movies like Da quando te ne andasti (1944) and the L&apos;intraprendente signor Dick (1947), her career was nearing its end. Later, she served as an ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia. It was once guessed that she had more than 50 golden curls on her head.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With prominent cheekbones, luminous skin and the most crystalline green eyes of her day, Gene Tierney&apos;s striking good looks helped propel her to stardom. Her best known role is the enigmatic murder victim in Vertigine (1944). She was also Oscar-nominated for Femmina folle (1945). Her acting performances were few in the 1950s as she battled a troubled emotional life that included hospitalization and shock treatment for depression.Gene Eliza Tierney was born on November 19, 1920 in Brooklyn, New York, to well-to-do parents, Belle Lavinia (Taylor) and Howard Sherwood Tierney. Her father was a successful insurance broker and her mother was a former teacher. Her childhood was lavish indeed. She also lived, at times, with her equally successful grandparents in Connecticut and New York. She was educated in the finest schools on the East Coast and at a finishing school in Switzerland.After two years in Europe, Gene returned to the US where she completed her education. By 1938 she was performing on Broadway in What a Life! and understudied for the Primrose Path (1938) at the same time. Her wealthy father set up a corporation that was only to promote her theatrical pursuits. Her first role consisted of carrying a bucket of water across the stage, prompting one critic to announce that &quot;Miss Tierney is, without a doubt, the most beautiful water carrier I have ever seen!&quot; Her subsequent roles Mrs O&apos;Brian Entertains (1939) and RingTwo (1939) were meatier and received praise from the tough New York critics. Critic Richard Watts wrote &quot;I see no reason why Miss Tierney should not have a long and interesting theatrical career, that is if the cinema does not kidnap her away.&quot;After being spotted by the legendary Darryl F. Zanuck during a stage performance of the hit show The Male Animal (1940), Gene was signed to a contract with 20th Century-Fox. Her first role as Barbara Hall in La baia di Hudson (1941) would be the send-off vehicle for her career. Later that year she appeared in Il vendicatore di Jess il bandito (1940). The next year would prove to be a very busy one for Gene, as she appeared in I misteri di Shanghai (1941), Inferno nel deserto (1941), La via del tabacco (1941) and La ribelle del sud (1941). She tried her hand at screwball comedy in Ragazze che sognano (1942), which was a great success. Her performances in each of these productions were masterful. In 1945 she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Ellen Brent in Femmina folle (1945). Though she didn&apos;t win, it solidified her position in Hollywood society. She followed up with another great performance as Isabel Bradley in the hit Il filo del rasoio (1946).In 1944, she played what is probably her best-known role (and, most critics agree, her most outstanding performance) in Otto Preminger&apos;s Vertigine (1944), in which she played murder victim named Laura Hunt. In 1947 Gene played Lucy Muir in the acclaimed Il fantasma e la signora Muir (1947). By this time Gene was the hottest player around, and the 1950s saw no letup as she appeared in a number of good films, among them I trafficanti della notte (1950), La madre dello sposo (1951), Figlio di ignoti (1951), Gli avventurieri di Plymouth (1952), La voce della calunnia (1953) and La mano sinistra di Dio (1955). The latter was to be her last performance for seven years. The pressures of a failed marriage to Oleg Cassini, the birth of a daughter with learning disabilities in 1943, and several unhappy love affairs resulted in Gene being hospitalized for depression. When she returned to the the screen in Tempesta su Washington (1962), her acting was as good as ever but there was no longer a big demand for her services.Her last feature film was Mentre Adamo dorme (1964), and her final appearance in the film industry was in a TV miniseries, Scruples (1980). Gene died of emphysema in Houston, Texas, on November 6, 1991, just two weeks shy of her 71st birthday.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Spencer Tracy was born four years after his brother Carroll to truck salesman John Edward and Caroline Brown Tracy. He attended Marquette Academy along with Pat O&apos;Brien and the two left school to enlist in the Navy at the start of World War I. He was still at Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia at the end of the war. At Ripon College he did well in the lead of &quot;The Truth&quot; and decided on acting as a career. In New York he roomed with O&apos;Brien while they attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1923 they both got nonspeaking parts as robots in &quot;R.U.R&quot;. In stock he supported himself with jobs as bellhop, janitor and salesman. John Ford saw his critically acclaimed performance in the lead role in the play &quot;The Last Mile&quot; and signed him to Risalendo il fiume (1930) for Fox. Despite appearing in 16 films there over the next 5 years, Tracy never achieved star status there (during his stint the studio had floundered and was absorbed into Darryl F. Zanuck&apos;s 20th Century Pictures). In 1935 he signed with MGM under the aegis of Irving Thalberg and his career flourished. He became the first actor to win back-to-back Oscars for Capitani coraggiosi (1937) and in a project he initially didn&apos;t want to star in, La cittÃ  dei ragazzi (1938). He was nominated for San Francisco (1936), Il padre della sposa (1950), Giorno maledetto (1955), Il vecchio e il mare (1958), ...E l&apos;uomo creÃ² Satana! (1960), Vincitori e vinti (1961), and Indovina chi viene a cena? (1967). He had a brief romantic relationship with Loretta Young in the 1930s and a lifelong one with Katharine Hepburn beginning in 1942. His Catholic beliefs precluded ever divorcing his wife Louise, though they lived apart. Tracy suffered from severe alcoholism and diabetes (from the late 1940&apos;s), which unfortunately impacted his willingness to accept several tailor-made roles in films that would become big hits. Although his drinking problems were well known, he was inarguably considered one of the best actors in Hollywood among his peers (he had a well deserved reputation for keeping co-stars on their toes for his oddly endearing scene-stealing tricks) and remained in demand. A few weeks after completion of Stanley Kramer&apos;s Indovina chi viene a cena? (1967), during which he suffered from lung congestion, he died of a heart attack.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">French director FranÃ§ois Truffaut began to assiduously go to the movies at age seven. He was also a great reader but not a good pupil. He left school at 14 and started working. In 1947, aged 15, he founded a film club and met AndrÃ© Bazin, a French critic, who became his protector. Bazin helped the delinquent Truffaut and also when he was put in jail because he deserted the army. In 1953 Truffaut published his first movie critiques in &quot;Les Cahiers du Cinema.&quot; In this magazine Truffaut, and some of his friends as passionate as he was, became defenders of what they call the &quot;author policy&quot;. In 1954, as a test, Truffaut directed his first short film. Two years afterwords he assisted Roberto Rossellini with some later abandoned projects.The year 1957 was an important one for him: he married Madeleine Morgenstern, the daughter of an important film distributor, and founded his own production company, Les Films du Carrosse; named after Jean Renoir&apos;s La carrozza d&apos;oro (1952). He also directed L&apos;etÃ  difficile (1957), considered the real first step of his cinematographic work. His other big year was 1959: the huge success of his first full-length film, I 400 colpi (1959), was the beginning of the New Wave, a new way of making movies in France. This was also the year his first daughter, Laura Truffaut, was born.From 1959 until his death, FranÃ§ois Truffaut&apos;s life and films are mixed up. Let&apos;s only note he had two other daughters Eva Truffaut (b. 1961) and Josephine (b. 1982, with French actress Fanny Ardant). Truffaut was the most popular and successful French film director ever. His main themes were passion, women, childhood and faithfulness.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Franz Waxman (Wachsmann) pursued his dream of a career in music despite his family&apos;s misgivings. He worked for several years as a bank teller and paid for piano, harmony and composition lessons with his salary. He later moved to Berlin, where he continued his study and progress as a musician. He was able to support himself by playing and arranging for a popular German jazz band, Weintraub Syncopaters, in the late 1920s. Friedrich Hollaender, who had written some music for the Weintraubs, gave Waxman his first chance to move into movie scoring by hiring him to orchestrate and conduct Hollander&apos;s score (an arrangement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) for the film that launched Marlene Dietrich, L&apos;angelo azzurro (1930), directed by Josef von Sternberg. During 1932 Waxman, a Jew, joined many other Jews leaving Germany as the Nazi vise closed irrevocably on free society. He continued working with Germanfilm makers in France. Waxman did musical arranging and co-scoring, usually with Allan Gray, for approximately 15 European movies (his first independent score was in 1932). &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; producer Erich Pommer liked Waxman&apos;s work and offered him the composing job for La leggenda di Liliom (1934), directed by Fritz Lang in France.Pommer decided to do Musica nell&apos;aria (1934), a Jerome Kern musical, which meant going to Hollywood. Waxman was asked to come along to do the arranging. Needing no further reason to remain in Europe as the Nazi clouds darkened over it, Waxman began a new chapter in Hollywood film music history. He fortunately had some spare time to study with &apos;Arnold Schoenberg&apos; after coming to Los Angeles, but he was soon talking to another new arrival, English director James Whale, about scoring La moglie di Frankenstein (1935) for Universal. Waxman gave Whale what he wanted--an unusual score to fit the quirky, somewhat over-the-top content of the film (in fact, some of this score was later used in other films). As Waxman worked for Universal through the 1930s, he found himself in assembly-line mode, sometimes sharing scoring credit, and doing a lot of arranging stock music, which was usually used for the studio&apos;s many serials. This cranked up Waxman&apos;s yearly film output to around 20 or so through 1940.By 1940, however, he was composing original music scores for other studios, beginning with the romantic music for Selznick Studios&apos; Rebecca - La prima moglie (1940)--the first Hollywood film for Alfred Hitchcock--and whimsical fare for MGM&apos;s Scandalo a Filadelfia (1940). In 1941 he was doing more work for MGM with Se mi vuoi sposami (1941) and his second Hitchcock score, Il sospetto (1941) from RKO. By 1943 and for the rest of the decade Waxman was usually scoring for Warner Bros., starting with Destinazione Tokyo (1943) and including music for some of that studio&apos;s classics of the period, such as Acque del Sud (1944) with Humphrey Bogart. Through the decade he was nominated for an Oscar seven times for Best Film Score.Waxman moved on to Paramount through the first half of the 1950s and garnered his two Oscars in back--to-back wins for Viale del tramonto (1950) and Un posto al sole (1951). This recognition finally underscored what was at the heart of all of Waxman&apos;s music: seriously focused attention on relaying a film&apos;s story through the content of the music. He would continue his scoring work for several studios into the 1960s, with three more nominations. Some of his music in the 1950s was recycled from his previous scores, as in the case of his third assignment for Hitchcock, La finestra sul cortile (1954) which contained used music. Waxman was also active in contemporary classical music. In 1947 he founded the Los Angeles International Music Festival and, as Music Director and Conductor, brought the premieres of works by world renowned contemporary composers to the Los Angeles cultural scene. Among his own output of such music was his popular &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot; for violin and orchestra. Waxman also composed for TV&apos;s Gunsmoke (1955), Il fuggiasco (1963), Peyton Place (1964) (he had composed the music for the film the series was based on, I peccatori di Peyton (1957)) and others. Waxman died relatively young, but because of his steady output, only fellow emigrant Max Steiner (who was nearly 20 years older and whose output entailed more than 200 arrangements of stock music, rather than original scores) was a more prolific early Hollywood composer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison in Iowa, to Mary Alberta (Brown) and Clyde Leonard Morrison, a pharmacist. He was of English, Ulster-Scots, and Irish ancestry.Clyde developed a lung condition that required him to move his family from Iowa to the warmer climate of southern California, where they tried ranching in the Mojave Desert. Until the ranch failed, Marion and his younger brother Robert E. Morrison swam in an irrigation ditch and rode a horse to school. When the ranch failed, the family moved to Glendale, California, where Marion delivered medicines for his father, sold newspapers and had an Airedale dog named &quot;Duke&quot; (the source of his own nickname). He did well at school both academically and in football. When he narrowly failed admission to Annapolis he went to USC on a football scholarship 1925-7. Tom Mix got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for football tickets. On the set he became close friends with director John Ford for whom, among others, he began doing bit parts, some billed as John Wayne. His first featured film was Il sottomarino (1930). After more than 70 low-budget westerns and adventures, mostly routine, Wayne&apos;s career was stuck in a rut until Ford cast him in Ombre rosse (1939), the movie that made him a star. He appeared in nearly 250 movies, many of epic proportions. From 1942-43 he was in a radio series, &quot;The Three Sheets to the Wind&quot;, and in 1944 he helped found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Conservative political organization, later becoming its President. His conservative political stance was also reflected in La battaglia di Alamo (1960), which he produced, directed and starred in. His patriotic stand was enshrined in Berretti verdi (1968) which he co-directed and starred in. Over the years Wayne was beset with health problems. In September 1964 he had a cancerous left lung removed; in March 1978 there was heart valve replacement surgery; and in January 1979 his stomach was removed. He received the Best Actor nomination for Iwo Jima, deserto di fuoco (1949) and finally got the Oscar for his role as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn in Il Grinta (1969). A Congressional Gold Medal was struck in his honor in 1979. He is perhaps best remembered for his parts in Ford&apos;s cavalry trilogy - Il massacro di Fort Apache (1948), I cavalieri del Nord Ovest (1949) and Rio Bravo (1950).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1940-09-05</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A new reigning 1960s international sex symbol took to the cinematic throne as soon as Raquel Welch emerged from the sea in her purposely depleted, furry prehistoric bikini. Tantalizingly wet with her garb clinging to all the right amazonian places, Un milione di anni fa (1966), if nothing else, captured the hearts and libidos of modern men (not to mention their teenage sons) while producing THE most definitive and best-selling pin-up poster of that time. After a major dry spell following the death of Marilyn Monroe in 1962, the auburn-maned Ms. Welch effortlessly assumed Marilyn&apos;s place and forever wiped away the notion that enduring sex goddesses came only in one form -- bottled blonds.She was born Jo Raquel Tejada on September 5, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois, the first of three children born to Bolivian-national Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo, a Spaniard-descendant aerospace engineer, and his Irish-American wife Josephine Sarah Hall, who was the daughter of American architect Emery Stanford Hall (1869-1939) and his wife Clara Louise Adams. The family moved to San Diego, California (her father was transferred) when Raquel was only two. Taking dance lessons as a youngster, she grew up to be quite a knockout and nailed a number of teen beauty titles (&quot;Miss Photogenic,&quot; &quot;Miss La Jolla,&quot; &quot;Miss Contour,&quot; &quot;Miss Fairest of the Fair&quot; and &quot;Miss San Diego&quot;). With her sights set on theater arts, she studied at San Diego State College on a scholarship starting in 1958 and married her first husband, high school sweetheart James Welch, the following year. They had two children Damon Welch (born 1959) and Tahnee Welch (born 1961). Tahnee went on to take advantage of her own stunning looks as an actress, most notably a prime featured role in Cocoon - L&apos;energia dell&apos;universo (1985).Off campus Raquel became a local TV weather girl in San Diego and eventually quit college. Following the end of her marriage in 1962 (she and Welch didn&apos;t divorce until 1964), she packed up her two children and moved to Dallas, Texas, where she modeled for Neiman-Marcus and worked as a barmaid for a time. Regrouping, she returned to California, migrated to Los Angeles, and made the rounds of film/TV auditions. Providing minor but sexy set decoration on the small screen (Vita da strega (1964), Un equipaggio tutto matto (1962) and Il virginiano (1962)) as well as the large (Elvis Presley&apos;s Il cantante del luna park (1964) and Doris Day&apos;s Non disturbate (1965)). Caught in the midst of the &quot;beach party&quot; craze, it&apos;s not surprising to find out that her first prime film role was La calda notte (1965), which concentrated more on musical guests The Righteous Brothers and Gary Lewis &amp; The Playboys than on Raquel&apos;s outstanding contributions. But 20th Century Fox certainly took notice and signed her up.With her very first film under contract (actually, she was on loan out to Britain&apos;s Hammer Studios at the time), she took on the remake of Sul sentiero dei mostri (1940) in the Carole Landis role and the rest is history. Raquel remained an international celebrity in her first few years of stardom. In England, she was quite revealing as the deadly sin representing &quot;lust&quot; for the comedy team of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in their vehicle Il mio amico il diavolo (1967), and as the title secret agent in the sexy spy spoof Fathom: bella intrepida e spia (1967). In Italy, she gained some exposure in primarily mediocre vehicles opposite such heartthrobs as Marcello Mastroianni. Back in the U.S., however, she caused quite a stir in her groundbreaking sex scenes with black athlete Jim Brown in the &quot;spaghetti western&quot; El Verdugo (1969), and as the transgendered title role in the unfathomable Il caso Myra Breckinridge (1970). Adapted from Gore Vidal novel, she created some unwelcome notoriety by locking horns with aging diva Mae West on the set. The instant cult movie was a laughingstock to all concerned and certainly didn&apos;t help Raquel&apos;s attempt at being taking seriously as an actress.Box office bombs abounded. Try as she might in such films as La bomba di Kansas City (1972) and Party selvaggio (1975), which drew some good reviews for her, her sexy typecast gave her little room to breathe. With determination, however, she partly offset this with modest supporting roles in larger ensemble pieces. She showed definite spark and won a Golden Globe for the swashbuckler I tre moschettieri (1973), and appeared to good advantage in the mystery thriller Un rebus per l&apos;assassino (1973). She planned on making a comeback in Cannery Row (1982), even agreeing to appear topless (which she had never done before), but was suddenly fired during production without notice. She sued MGM for breach of contract and ultimately won a $15 million settlement, but it didn&apos;t help her film career and only helped to label her as trouble on a set. TV movies became a positive milieu for Raquel as she developed sound vehicles for herself such as The Legend of Walks Far Woman (1982) and Quando morire (1987). She also found a lucrative avenue pitching beauty products in infomercials and developing exercise videos Ã  la Jane Fonda.Raquel took advantage of her modest singing and dancing abilities by performing in splashy Las Vegas showrooms and starring in such plausible stage vehicles as &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; and &quot;Victor/Victoria.&quot; Still a dazzler broaching age 70, Raquel continues to show up here and there and still can turn heads. She has even spoofed her own diva image on occasion, most memorably on Seinfeld (1989). More recently she has co-starred in the Hispanic-oriented TV series American Family (2002) and in the short-lived comedy Welcome to the Captain (2008), and appeared in the movies Tortilla Soup (2001), La rivincita delle bionde (2001) and Forget About It (2006). She is separated from her fourth husband Richie Palmer, who is 14 years her junior.</rdfs:comment>

When his mother died (he was six) he traveled the world with his father. He was orphaned at 15 after his father&apos;s death and became the ward of Dr. Maurice Bernstein of Chicago. In 1931, he graduated from the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois. He turned down college offers for a sketching tour of Ireland. He tried unsuccessfully to enter the London and Broadway stages, traveling some more in Morocco and Spain. where he fought in the bullringRecommendations by Thornton Wilder and Alexander Woollcott got him into Katharine Cornell&apos;s road company, with which he made his New York debut as Tybalt in 1934. The same year, he married, directed his first short, and appeared on radio for the first time. He began working with John Houseman and formed the Mercury Theatre with him in 1937.In 1938, they produced &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;, famous for its broadcast version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (intended as a Halloween prank). His first film to be seen by the public was Quarto potere (1941), a commercial failure losing RKO $150,000, but regarded by many as the best film ever made. Many of his subsequent films were commercial failures and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948.In 1956, he directed L&apos;infernale Quinlan (1958); it failed in the United States but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World&apos;s Fair. In 1975, in spite of all his box-office failures, he received the American Film Institute&apos;s Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1984, the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor, the D.W. Griffith Award. His reputation as a filmmaker steadily climbed thereafter.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Violinist and conductor Victor Young was a prolific composer and arranger, who worked on more than 300 film scores over a period of twenty years. He came from an impoverished, but musical background and was trained on the violin at the Warsaw Imperial Conservatory, later studying piano in Paris under the French master Isidor Philipp. A prodigious talent, Young made his professional debut as a teenager with the Warsaw Philharmonic. However, World War I intervened, and he spent several months interned in a prison facility in Russia. Somehow, he was able to escape. By 1920, he had found his way to the United States and resumed work as a violinist with the Central Park Casino Orchestra in Chicago. He also diversified as an arranger and conductor for radio and the theatre. His first connection with the film industry came about, when he secured a position as assistant director with the Balaban and Katz cinema chain, writing and arranging as many as five (silent) film scores a week.During the late 1920&apos;s, Young was back as musical director for &apos;Harvest of Stars&apos; on radio, and as a talent scout for Edison Records. He briefly arranged for bandleader Ted Fio Rito before fronting his own orchestra in 1935, backed by a recording deal with Decca. He worked with many of the great vocalists of the period, including Judy Garland, Lee Wiley and The Boswell Sisters. His high profile brought him to the attention of Paramount, where he was signed to a one-year contract in 1936. He worked for the studio again between 1940 and 1949, but, by that time, his reputation had become so formidable that he came to be regarded as the pre-eminent film composer, and assigned the lion&apos;s share of A-grade features. His music subtly and seamlessly integrated into dramas like Vento selvaggio (1942), Per chi suona la campana (1943), Amarti Ã¨ la mia dannazione (1948), John Ford&apos;s Un uomo tranquillo (1952) and the western classic Il cavaliere della valle solitaria (1953).Young also wrote countless evergreen songs, many for top-flight singers, like Bing Crosby. His first big hit was &quot;Sweet Sue&quot; (popularly recorded by Tommy Dorsey &amp; His Orchestra), followed by the melodic jazz standard &quot;Stella by Starlight&quot; (which served as the theme for La casa sulla scogliera (1944)) and the ballad &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; (a huge hit for Nat &apos;King&apos; Cole, who featured the song in the movie Istanbul (1957)). For Broadway, Young wrote both music and lyrics for &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, in 1955. Nominated for a staggering 22 Academy Awards, Young had his only win (for Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (1956)), rather sadly, after his sudden death from a stroke at the age of 56. It has been suggested, that his film compositions, while polished, lacked the Ã©lan or authoritative stamp of a Max Steiner or a Bernard Herrmann. Nonetheless, the sheer volume and enduring popularity of Young&apos;s music ensure his immortality among the ranks of the great songwriters and film composers of the 20th century.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Louis Germain David de FunÃ¨s de Galarza was born on July 31, 1914, in Courbevoie, France. His father, named Carlos Luis de Funes de Galarza, was a former lawyer of Seville, Spain, who became a diamond cutter. His mother, named Leonor Soto Reguera, was of Spanish and Portugese extraction.Young Louis de FunÃ¨s was fond of drawing and piano playing. He dropped out of school and worked various jobs, mostly as a jazz pianist at Pigalle, making his customers laugh every time he made a grimace. He studied acting for one year at the Simon acting school. There he made some useful contacts, including Daniel GÃ©lin among others. During the occupation of Paris in the Second World War, he continued his piano studies at a music school, where he fell in love with a secretary, named Jeanne de Maupassant, a grand-niece of writer Guy de Maupassant. She had fallen in love with &quot;the young man who played jazz like god&quot;; they married in 1943, and had two sons born in 1944 and 1949. FunÃ¨s continued playing piano at clubs, knowing there wasn&apos;t much call for a short, balding, skinny actor. His wife and Daniel Gelin encouraged him until he managed to overcome his rejection. He made his film debut in 1945, at the age of 31, and went on playing about one hundred film roles in the next twenty years.Louis de FunÃ¨s shot to international fame in the 1960&apos;s after his roles in such slapstick comedies as Una ragazza a Saint Tropez (1964) and the Fantomas 70 (1964) trilogy. He brilliantly portrayed a funny French policeman, whose hilarious hyperactivity, uncontrolled anger, and sardonic laughter produced a highly comic effect. FunÃ¨s was voted the most favorite actor in France in 1968, and remained very popular in Europe during the 1970&apos;s. He also continued to play on stage during his career as a film star, and was acclaimed for his stage works in classic French theatre. FunÃ¨s was instrumental in making film adaptations of such theatre plays as &apos;Oscar continues&apos; and the MoliÃ¨re&apos;s &apos;The Miser&apos;, among other plays.Nicknamed &quot;the man with the forty faces per minute&quot;, Louis de FunÃ¨s played bit parts in over eighty films, before he got his first leading roles, eventually becoming the leading French comedian. He co-starred with the major French actors of the time, including Jean Marais and MylÃ¨ne Demongeot in the Fantomas trilogy, and also Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Bourvil, Coluche, Annie Girardot, and Yves Montand. FunÃ¨s&apos;s collaboration with director GÃ©rard Oury produced a memorable tandem of FunÃ¨s-Bourvil. He also worked with Jean Girault in the famous &apos;Gendarmes&apos; series. In a departure from the Gendarme image, FunÃ¨s collaborated with Claude Zidi, who wrote for him a new character full of nuances and frankness in L&apos;ala o la coscia? (1976), which is arguably the best of his roles.FunÃ¨s played over 130 roles in film and over 100 roles on stage. From 1943-1983 Louis de FunÃ¨s was married to Jeanne Barthelemy de Maupassant. Their son, Olivier De FunÃ¨s , had a brief acting career before becoming a pilot with Air France, his other son, named Patric de Funes, became a medical doctor. Louis de FunÃ¨s was also a rose grower, a variety of roses has been named the &quot;Louis de FunÃ¨s rose&quot; after him. He died of a heart attack and complications of a stroke on January 27, 1983, in Nantes, France. He was laid to rest in the CimetiÃ¨re du Cellier, and a monument of him was erected in the rose-garden of his wife&apos;s castle.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1940-06-06</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Is understanding human behavior important to being a good actor? If so, then it&apos;s no surprise that Richard Paul is eminently qualified for his successful acting career. A native Californian with a BA in public affairs from Claremont Men&apos;s College, now Claremont McKenna College, Richard earned an MA in psychology from California State University at Los Angeles. He then began work toward a Ph. D. at the University of Arizona. The following years were a curious mixture of psychology and acting: from playing Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady, &quot; to traveling back and forth between Arizona, and Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, California, where he served his internship in Clinical Psychology, and worked as a staff psychologist. Falling in love in a mental hospital may seem unusual, but that is where he met his future wife Patty, a student worker there. He developed his own unique program there--acting lessons for the patients. At night, Richard went to L.A.&apos;s radio station KPFK to appear on Firesign Theater. He worked on two albums with the group, &quot;Roller Maidens from Outer Space&quot; (playing Ozzie Nelson among several voices) and &quot;As Time Flies, &quot; now Firesign classics. No matter where he was working or studying during those years, Richard returned every summer to the Pomona Valley Shakespeare Festival directed by Jesse Swan first in Balch Auditorium at Scripps, then at Garrison Theater, where he immersed himself in the great characters of Falstaff, in Henry IV, part 1, Toby Belch in Twelfth Night, Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet, Bottom in Midsummer Nights Dream, Baptista in Taming of the Shrew with the best Petruchio he&apos;s ever seen Mike Connolly, Arnolphe in the Amorous Flea, and a variety of other roles. In 1968 Richard married Patty, and together they spent the requisite early years struggling to make a living, with Richard doing commercials, voice-overs, and working on the doctorate--torn between two careers. The turning point came when Richard accepted a nine month road engagement starring in &quot;W.C. Fields, 80 proof, &quot; a two-man show. The die was cast, and with Patty&apos;s support, Richard chose a career as a performer, &quot;A decision I&apos;ve never regretted--well, only twice a week.&quot; In the years that followed, Richard did a number of voice-overs for cartoons including Mickey Mouse and Uncle Remus for Disney. Early on-camera roles included &quot;Maude, &quot; &quot;Mary Hartman, &quot; and &quot;Mitzi Gaynor&apos;s Roarin&apos; in the Twenties, &quot; where he reprised the Fields role. A lunch break interview during filming of a dog food commercial led to the costarring role of Mayor Teddy Burnside (&quot;your mayor by a landslide&quot;) in ABC- TV&apos;s &quot;Carter Country, &quot; where his order to: &quot;Handle it! Handle it!&quot; became a national catch phrase. The series ran 2 years. Richard starred with Shirley Hemphill in &quot;One in a Million&quot; (another ABC series), and costarred in 1982 with Dean Jones in &quot;Herbie the Love Bug&quot; on CBS. Recent stage roles include the Cowardly Lion in &quot;The Wizard of Oz, &quot; with Cathy Rigby, Mayor Shinn in the &quot;Music Man&quot; with John Davidson, Jimmy in &quot;No, no, Nanette, &quot; and the Governor in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; with Ruta Lee. How did Richard Paul get Milos Forman to cast him in the role of Jerry Falwell in the award winning &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt?&quot; Preparation helps. Richard has had a lot of practice playing preachers: from the pleasant parson who tried to censor &quot;WKRP, &quot; to the televangelical adversary of Patty Duke on &quot;Hail to the Chief, &quot; to the man who finally married &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King, &quot; to his critically acclaimed previous portrayal of Falwell in &quot;Fall from Grace.&quot; with Bernadette Peters. Richard worked on two other movies in 1996 in addition to &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt.&quot; He played a diamond smuggler in &quot;The Glass Cage&quot; with Eric Roberts, and a college dean in a leading role in &quot;Mind Games.&quot; Director Paul Bartel cast Richard as comic heavies in the cult classic &quot;Eating Raoul&quot; and in &quot;Not For Publication.&quot; He went to Yugoslavia to star with Eva Gabor in &quot;Princess Academy.&quot; In 1997 he appeared on &quot;Rosanne&quot; and &quot;Drew Carey, &quot; Richard and Patty lived in Studio City. His other interests included singing (an operatic tenor), writing, walking, and dieting forever. For seven years he volunteered every week as a reader for the Braille Institute&apos;s Recording program. An animal lover, Richard has also volunteered his time for years to Actors and Others for Animals. Still interested in psychology, he was a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and served on the Mental Health Advisory Board to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisor. A Universal Life Church minister, Richard confesses: &quot;I married my wife once, but I married her brother twice.&quot;</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, in Weston-Super-Mare, England, to Muriel Evelyn (Cross) and Reginald Francis Cleese. He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, &quot;The Goon Show,&quot; starring the legendary Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, and Harry Secombe.Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university&apos;s legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python Graham Chapman. Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name &quot;Cambridge Circus.&quot; When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met Terry Gilliam, another future Python.Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, &quot;I&apos;m Sorry, I&apos;ll Read That Again&quot;, based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in At Last the 1948 Show (1967), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included The Frost Report (1966) and Marty Feldman&apos;s program Marty (1968). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus (1969), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - Monty Python e il Sacro Graal (1975), Brian di Nazareth (1979), Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982), and Monty Python - Il senso della vita (1983). Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth collaborated in the legendary television series Basil e Sybil (1975), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy Un pesce di nome Wanda (1988), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with Il mondo non basta (1999), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese&apos;s other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with Connie Booth and a daughter with his second wife, Barbara Trentham.Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An actor and producer known as much for his versatility as he is for his handsome face, Golden Globe-winner Brad Pitt&apos;s most widely recognized role may be Tyler Durden in Fight Club (1999). However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in L&apos;arte di vincere (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean&apos;s Eleven - Fate il vostro gioco (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography.Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for &quot;el Pollo Loco&quot;.Pitt&apos;s earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Destini (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma &amp; Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Fuga dal mondo dei sogni (1992).But Pitt&apos;s career hit an upswing with his casting in In mezzo scorre il fiume (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt&apos;s subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in Una vita al massimo (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Intervista col vampiro (1994) and Vento di passioni (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Seven (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in L&apos;esercito delle 12 scimmie (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt&apos;s portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Bastardi senza gloria (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for Il curioso caso di Benjamin Button (2008) and L&apos;arte di vincere (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael PeÃ±a.Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1935-12-01</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Woody Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg on December 1, 1935 in Brooklyn, New York, to Nettie (Cherrie), a bookkeeper, and Martin Konigsberg, a waiter and jewellery engraver. His father was of Russian Jewish descent, and his maternal grandparents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today.Allen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Ciao Pussycat (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time.It was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody&apos;s theoretical directorial debut was in Che fai, rubi? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Prendi i soldi e scappa (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy.While best known for his romantic comedies Io e Annie (1977) and Manhattan (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his &quot;early, funny ones&quot; of Il dittatore dello stato libero di Bananas (1971), Amore e guerra (1975) and Tutto quello che avreste voluto sapere sul sesso ma non avete mai osato chiedere (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Io e Annie (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah e le sue sorelle (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Interiors (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Crimini e misfatti (1989), Mariti e mogli (1992), La dea dell&apos;amore (1995), Celebrity (1998) and Harry a pezzi (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Scoop (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years, he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With her expressive blue eyes, soft, Southern-tinged voice and an acting range that can carry her from hysterically funny to terrifying in seconds, Patricia Arquette is one of the most underrated and talented actresses of her generation. Though she has been working for years, she&apos;s always stayed just under the radar of true stardom, despite a 1995 marriage to Nicolas Cage.Patricia was born in Chicago, though the family soon moved to a commune near Arlington, Virginia. Her parents, Lewis Arquette, an actor, and Brenda Denaut (nÃ©e Nowak), an acting teacher and therapist, had 4 other children: Rosanna Arquette, Richmond Arquette, Alexis Arquette, and David Arquette, all actors. Her paternal grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was also an entertainer. Patricia&apos;s mother was from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Poland and Russia), while Patricia&apos;s father had French-Canadian, Swiss-German, and English ancestry.At 15, Patricia ran away from home to live with her sister Rosanna and, after initial insecurity, got her start in Pretty Smart (1987). A year later, she gained attention for her starring role in Nightmare 3 - I guerrieri del sogno (1987), considered by many to be the best film of the Nightmare series. In 1989, Patricia&apos;s son, Enzo (father is Paul Rossi), was born. Soon after, her career took off, and she has since appeared in such critically acclaimed movies as Una vita al massimo (1993), Oltre Rangoon (1995), Ethan Frome - La storia di un amore proibito (1993), Strade perdute (1997) and Amori e disastri (1996). She won a CableACE award in 1991 for her portrayal of a deaf epileptic in Fiore selvaggio (1991). In 1997, after her mother died of breast cancer, Patricia took the lead in the fight against the disease. She has run in the annual Race for the Cure and in 1999 was the Lee National Denim Day spokesperson.</rdfs:comment>

His debut as the strict Chip Diller in Animal House (1978) almost seems like an inside joke, but he managed to escape almost unnoticed from that role. A cena con gli amici (1982) became the turning point after a couple of television series and a number of less-than-memorable movie roles. In a cast of soon-to-be stars, he more than held his end up, and we saw a glimpse of the real lunatic image of The Bacon. He also starred in Footloose (1984), Un amore rinnovato (1988), Tremors (1990) with Fred Ward, Linea mortale (1990), and Apollo 13 (1995).Bacon is married to actress Kyra Sedgwick, with whom he has 2 children.</rdfs:comment>

Her father, Solomon Feldthouse, was a traveling musician originally from Idaho, and her mother, Cathryn Balk, was a belly dancer. Her parents split up soon after. Fairuza grew up just north of San Francisco, California on a commune-type ranch. Her mother later found work in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was there that Fairuza began her career at age 9 on the ABC special The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (1983). Two years later, she went to the United Kingdom where she attended the Royal Academy of Ballet, the Ramona Beauchamp Agency, and the Bush Davies Performing Arts School. Fairuza worked for the Walt Disney Company for a while; at 11, she was chosen from 1,200 girls to star as Dorothy in Nel fantastico mondo di Oz (1985). The next year she starred, prophetically enough, as Zero in magia (1986) a harbinger of her breakout role in Giovani streghe (1996) 10 years later.Fairuza and her mother remained in London until 1988, then went to Paris where the 15-year-old starred in Valmont (1989). The next year they returned to Vancouver and Fairuza enrolled in high school, but ended up doing correspondence courses after proving shy in class. Back in Hollywood she starred in a string of movies, including Deserto di Laramie (1992), for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress. Following further television and film work, she achieved cult status with her starring role as a teenage witch in her breakout film, Giovani streghe (1996). That year she also appeared in L&apos;isola perduta (1996), in which she did some belly-dancing and attracted the attention of Lancashire, England-born co-star David Thewlis. They did another movie together, American Perfekt (1997).Fairuza was also the love interest in the wildly-popular Waterboy (1998) and had a major role in American History X (1998). With a half-dozen movies for 2000, Fairuza is much in demand. Her interests are writing poetry and stories, playing the guitar, singing (her main enjoyment), and dancing. She lives in Venice, California and has an apartment in New York City.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Antonio Banderas, one of Spain&apos;s most famous faces, was a soccer player until breaking his foot at the age of fourteen; he is now an international film star known for playing Zorro in the eponymous film series.He was born JosÃ© Antonio DomÃ­nguez Banderas on August 10, 1960, in MÃ¡laga, Andalusia, Spain. His father, Jose Dominguez, was a policeman in the Spanish civil guards. His mother, DoÃ±a Ana Banderas Gallego, was a school teacher. Young Banderas was brought up a Roman Catholic. He wanted to play soccer professionally and made much success playing for his school team until the age of 14, albeit his dream ended when he broke his foot. At that time he developed a passion for theatre after seeing the stage production of &apos;Hair&apos;. Banderas began his acting studies at the School of Dramatic Art in MÃ¡laga, and made his acting debut at a small theatre in MÃ¡laga. He was arrested by the Spanish police for performance in a play by Bertolt Brecht, because of political censorship under the rule of General Francisco Franco. Banderas spent a whole night at the police station, he had three or four such arrests while he was working with a small theatre troupe that toured all over Spain and was giving performances in small town theatres and on the street.In 1979, at the age of 19, he moved to Madrid in pursuit of an acting career. Being a struggling young actor, he also worked as a waiter and took small modeling jobs. At that time he joined the troupe at the National Theatre of Spain, becoming the youngest member of the company. Banderas&apos;s stage performances caught the attention of film director Pedro AlmodÃ³var, who cast the young actor in his film debut Labirinto di passioni (1982). Banderas and Almodovar joined forces in making innovative and sexually provocative movies during the 1980s. In 1984 Banderas made headlines in Spain with his performance as a gay man, making his first male-to-male on-screen kiss in Almodovar&apos;s La legge del desiderio (1987). Banderas&apos;s long and fruitful collaboration with Pedro AlmodÃ³var eventually prepared him for international recognition that came with his work in the Academy Award-nominated film Donne sull&apos;orlo di una crisi di nervi (1988). In 1991 he appeared as an object of Madonna&apos;s affection in A letto con Madonna (1991).In 1992 Banderas made his Hollywood debut with I re del mambo (1992). Because he did not speak English at that time, his dialogue for the film was taught to him phonetically. Banderas shot to international fame with his sensitive performance as a lover of Tom Hanks&apos; AIDS-infected lawyer in Philadelphia (1993), then played opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in Intervista col vampiro (1994). Banderas further established himself as one of Hollywood&apos;s leading men after co-starring in Evita (1996) opposite Madonna in the title role. In 1998 he won acclaim for his portrayal of Zorro, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones, in La maschera di Zorro (1998). For the role as Zorro Banderas took training with the Olympic national fencing team in Spain, and practiced his moves with real steel swords, then he used the lighter aluminum swords in the movie.

In 1999 Banderas made his directorial debut in Pazzi in Alabama (1999), starring his wife, Melanie Griffith. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros opposite Salma Hayek in Frida (2002). He voiced Puss in Boots in the Shrek franchise.Banderas established himself as internationally known Latin heartthrob with charismatic looks, and was chosen as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by the People magazine in 1996. He won numerous awards and nominations for his works in film, including three ALMA awards and three Golden Globe nominations, among many other. From 1996 to 2014, Banderas was married to American actress Melanie Griffith and the couple have one daughter Stella born in 1996. Outside of his acting profession, Banderas has been a passionate soccer fan and a staunch supporter of the Real Madrid Football Club. He shares time between his two residencies, one is in the United States, and one in the South of Spain.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Since melting audiences&apos; hearts - at the age of six - in Steven Spielberg&apos;s beloved sci-fi blockbuster, E.T. - L&apos;extra-terrestre (1982), Drew Barrymore has emerged as one of the most endearing and talented actresses of her generation.Drew Blyth Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, to actors John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore (nÃ©e Ildiko Jaid Mako). Her father came from a long showbusiness legacy, as the son of actors John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, while her mother was the daughter of Hungarian refugees.Despite a turbulent adolescence, Barrymore&apos;s star was officially on the rise during the mid-1990s; following a string of &quot;bad girl&quot; parts in La mia peggiore amica (1992), Guncrazy (1992), and, well, Bad Girls (1994), she made notable appearances in A proposito di donne (1995), Woody Allen&apos;s Tutti dicono I Love You (1996), and the game-changing horror hit Scream (1996).An eclectic mix of high-profile and low-key film projects followed - such as Prima o poi me lo sposo (1998), La leggenda di un amore - Cinderella (1998), Mai stata baciata (1999), Charlie&apos;s Angels (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), I ragazzi della mia vita (2001), and Confessioni di una mente pericolosa (2002) - proving to once-cynical audiences that Barrymore was not only a capable leading lady, but also a gifted and versatile actor.Headline parts in 50 volte il primo bacio (2004), L&apos;amore in gioco (2005), and Scrivimi una canzone (2007) came next, followed by the critically-lauded Grey Gardens - Dive per sempre (2009), for which she earned Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards for her portrayal of Edith Bouvier Beale.In 2009, Barrymore - whose production company, Flower Films, has spawned several lucrative features - made her long-awaited directional debut with the comedy-drama Whip It (2009); TIME Magazine hailed her as &quot;a sensitive director who knows how and when to let an emotional moment linger on the screen.&quot;Alongside a recurring guest spot (as the voice of Jillian; 2005-13) on I Griffin (1999), recent acting roles have included Amore a mille... miglia (2010), Qualcosa di straordinario (2012), Insieme per forza (2014), Miss You Already (2015), and the acclaimed Netflix series Santa Clarita Diet (2017), on which she stars and serves as executive producer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kim Basinger was born December 8, 1953, in Athens, Georgia, the third of five children. Both her parents had been in entertainment, her dad had played big-band jazz, and her mother had performed water ballet in several Esther Williams movies. Kim was introspective, from her father&apos;s side. As a schoolgirl, she was very shy. To help her overcome this, her parents had Kim study ballet from an early age. By the time she reached sweet sixteen, the once-shy Kim entered the Athens Junior Miss contest. From there, she went on to win the Junior Miss Georgia title, and traveled to New York to compete in the national Junior Miss pageant. Kim, who had blossomed to a 5&apos; 7&quot; beauty, was offered a contract on the spot with the Ford Modeling Agency. At the age of 20, Kim was a top model commanding $1,000 a day. Throughout the early 1970s, she appeared on dozens of magazine covers and in hundreds of ads, most notably as the Breck girl. Kim took acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse, performed in various Greenwich Village clubs, and she sang under the stage name Chelsea. Kim moved to Los Angeles in 1976, ready to conquer Hollywood. Kim broke into television doing episodes of such hit series as Charlie&apos;s Angels (1976). In 1980, she married Ron Snyder (they divorced in 1989). In movies, she had roles like being a Bond girl in Mai dire mai (1983) and playing a small-town Texan beauty in Nadine - Un amore a prova di proiettile (1987). Her breakout role was as photojournalist Vicki Vale in the blockbuster hit Batman (1989). There was no long-orchestrated campaign on her part to snag this plum role, Kim was a last-minute replacement for Sean Young. This took her to a career high.With perhaps too much disposable income, Kim headed up an investment group that purchased the entire town of Braselton, in her native Georgia, for $20 million (she would later have to sell it). In 1993, Kim married Alec Baldwin, and in 1995 they had a daughter, Ireland Eliesse. Kim took some time off to stay at home with her child. Kim, who loves animals and is a strict vegetarian, devoted energy to animal rights issues, and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), even posing for some ads. In 1997, Kim gave an Oscar-winning performance in the film noir classic L.A. Confidential (1997). Kim&apos;s salary for Sognando l&apos;Africa (2000) was $5,000,000, putting her firmly in the category of big-name movie star. And no doubt there are still many great things ahead, in the career of cover girl turned Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Luc Besson spent the first years of his life following his parents, scuba diving instructors, around the world. His early life was entirely aquatic. He already showed amazing creativity as a youth, writing early drafts of Le grand bleu (1988) and Il quinto elemento (1997), as an adolescent bored in school. He planned on becoming a marine biologist specializing in dolphins until a diving accident at age 17 which rendered him unable to dive any longer. He moved back to Paris, where he was born, and only at age 18 did he first have an urban life or television. He realized that film was a medium which he could combine all his interests in various arts together, so he began taking odd jobs on various films. He moved to America for three years, then returned to France and formed Les Films de Loups - his own production company, which later changed its name to Les Films de Dauphins. He is now able to dive again.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kenneth Charles Branagh was born on December 10, 1960, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to parents William Branagh, a plumber and carpenter, and Frances (Harper), both born in 1930. He has two siblings, William Branagh, Jr. (born 1955) and Joyce Branagh (born 1970). When he was nine, his family escaped The Troubles by moving to Reading, Berkshire, England. At 23, Branagh joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he took on starring roles in &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He soon found the RSC too large and impersonal and formed his own, the Renaissance Theatre Company, which now counts Prince Charles as one of its royal patrons. At 29, he directed Enrico V (1989), where he also co-starred with his then-wife, Emma Thompson. The film brought him Best Actor and Best Director Oscar nominations. In 1993, he brought Shakespeare to mainstream audiences again with his hit adaptation of Molto rumore per nulla (1993), which featured an all-star cast that included, among others, Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton and Keanu Reeves. At 30, he published his autobiography and, at 34, he directed and starred as &quot;Victor Frankenstein&quot; in the big-budget adaptation of Mary Shelley&apos;s novel, Frankenstein di Mary Shelley (1994), with Robert De Niro as the monster himself. In 1996, Branagh wrote, directed and starred in a lavish adaptation of Hamlet (1996). His superb film acting work also includes a wide range of roles such as in Celebrity (1998), Wild Wild West (1999), La strada per El Dorado (2000), Operazione Valchiria (2008) and his stunning portrayal of Laurence Olivier in Marilyn (2011), where once again he offered a great performance that was also nominated for an Academy Award.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A slight comic actor chiefly known for his boyish charm, Matthew Broderick was born on March 21, 1962 in New York City, to Patricia Broderick (nÃ©e Biow), a playwright and painter, and James Broderick, an actor. His father had Irish and English ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Poland).Matthew initially took up acting at New York&apos;s upper-crust Walden School after being sidelined from his athletic pursuits (football and soccer) by a knee injury. His father got him his stage debut at age 17 in a workshop production of the play &quot;On Valentine&apos;s Day&quot;. Matthew&apos;s career then accelerated with parts in two Neil Simon projects: the play &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; (1982-83) and the feature film Per fortuna c&apos;Ã¨ un ladro in famiglia (1983). Broderick reprised the role of Eugene in &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; (1988), the second installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway production and the film adaptation (Frenesie... militari (1988)). For the third and final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced by Jonathan Silverman. In 1983, the same year as Per fortuna c&apos;Ã¨ un ladro in famiglia (1983), Broderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedy Wargames - Giochi di guerra (1983). Since then he has had his fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films including Fuga dal futuro - Danger Zone (1987) also starring Helen Hunt, whom he subsequently dated; Innamorati cronici (1997); and Inspector Gadget (1999). Other films he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected include Ma capita tutto a me? (1992) with his Una pazza giornata di vacanza (1986) co-star Jeffrey Jones; La notte che non c&apos;incontrammo (1993); Morti di salute (1994); and Il rompiscatole (1996) with Jim Carrey, which got him an MTV &quot;Best Fight&quot; award nomination; and the MTV film Election (1999) with Reese Witherspoon. In 1985 he was involved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his then fiancÃ©e Jennifer Grey. The crash killed a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke his leg in the accident, which happened just as Una pazza giornata di vacanza (1986), his biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but critical flop) and special effects blockbuster Godzilla (1998) gave Broderick his first action role (should any &quot;Godzilla&quot; sequels be planned, he is under contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage in New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as &quot;How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying&quot; or in revivals of old &quot;show people&quot;plays, such as &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;. In 1996 Broderick attempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor in Infinity (1996), working very closely with his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical or commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since May 1997 he has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker. He was previously engaged to both Helen Hunt and dated Lili Taylor. In 1999 he donned a trenchcoat for the children&apos;s film Inspector Gadget (1999), alongside Rupert Everett as the evil villain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the musical smash &quot;The Producers&quot; (based on the 1968 Mel Brooks film of the same name). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he lost to his co-star, Nathan Lane.</rdfs:comment>

He lived in Navan, County Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability to play men from both backgrounds convincingly). His father left the household when Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The death, in 1991, of Cassandra Harris, his wife of eleven years, left him with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra&apos;s first marriage and Sean from their marriage. Since her death, he has had two children with his second wife, Keely Shaye Brosnan.Brosnan is most famous for starring in the TV series Mai dire sÃ¬ (1982) as the title character, as well as portraying famous movie character James Bond in GoldenEye (1995), Il domani non muore mai (1997), Il mondo non basta (1999) and La morte puÃ² attendere (2002).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sandra Annette Bullock was born in Arlington, a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. Her mother, Helga Bullock (nÃ©e Helga Mathilde Meyer), was a German opera singer. Her father, John W. Bullock, was an American voice teacher, who was born in Alabama, of German descent. Sandra grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister, chef Gesine Bullock-Prado, and spent much of her childhood in Nuremberg, Germany. She often performed in the children&apos;s chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in Quella cosa chiamata amore (1993). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in Demolition Man (1993) and Ricordando Hemingway (1993), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit Speed (1994). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in The Blind Side (2009) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters Ricatto d&apos;amore (2009), Corpi da reato (2013) and Gravity (2013) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Nicolas Cage was born Nicolas Kim Coppola in Long Beach, California, the son of comparative literature professor August Coppola (whose brother is director Francis Ford Coppola) and dancer/choreographer Joy Vogelsang. He is of Italian (father) and Polish and German (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s.Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fuori di testa (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis&apos; Rusty il selvaggio (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in La ragazza di San Diego (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career.His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor&apos;s remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in Cotton Club (1984).In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage Coppola (b.1992). He also has a son with his ex-wife, Alice Kim Cage.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James Francis Cameron was born on August 16, 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. He moved to the United States in 1971. The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University before switching to English, and eventually dropping out. He then drove a truck to support his screenwriting ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on Roger Corman&apos;s I magnifici sette nello spazio (1980) and had his first experience as a director with a two week stint on PiraÃ±a paura (1981) before being fired.He then wrote and directed Terminator (1984), a futuristic action-thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. It was a low budget independent film, but Cameron&apos;s superb, dynamic direction made it a surprise mainstream success and it is now regarded as one of the most iconic pictures of the 1980s. After this came a string of successful, bigger budget science-fiction action films such as Aliens - Scontro finale (1986), The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2 - Il giorno del giudizio (1991). In 1990, Cameron formed his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. In 1997, he wrote and directed Titanic (1997), a romance epic about two young lovers from different social classes who meet on board the famous ship. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned eleven Academy Awards. It became the highest grossing movie of all time. The rest is history.James Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer Gale Anne Hurd, who produced several of his films. In 2000, he married actress Suzy Amis, who appeared in Titanic, and they have three children.</rdfs:comment>

Campbell first came to our TV screens in the hit Drama series Cinque in famiglia (1994). Described as TV&apos;s most believable teenager, her first major film role came in the form of innocent victim &quot;Sidney Prescott&quot; in Scream (1996), the film which re-defined the slasher genre.She joined the cast of the acclaimed series House of Cards In 2016, playing Leann Harvey, shortly after in 2018 she starred opposite Dwayne Johnson in the action movie Skyscraper.Many film offers came her way but, as she was filming Cinque in famiglia (1994) for nine months of the year, the filming schedules often clashed. So in 2000, she announced that she was to leave the award winning show to concentrate on a film career.Spreading through many genres, her film credits to date include the romantic comedy Appuntamento a tre (1999) alongside Matthew Perry and the erotic thriller Sex crimes - Giochi pericolosi (1998) with Denise Richards and Matt Dillon, though she has turned to a more art house approach with the critically acclaimed Panic (2000) and, more recently, Last Call - Genio ribelle (2002), both directed by Henry Bromell.She is an animal lover and describes herself as having a dry, often offensive sense of humor.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jim Carrey, Canadian-born and a U.S. citizen since 2004, is an actor and producer famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura - L&apos;acchiappanimali (1994), Scemo &amp; piÃ¹ scemo (1994) and The Mask - Da zero a mito (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.James Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally &quot;CarrÃ©&quot;, and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his rÃ©sumÃ© to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).Carrey&apos;s early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.Carrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk&apos;s, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom The Duck Factory (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.Carrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Se ti mordo... sei mio (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue si Ã¨ sposata (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Le ragazze della Terra sono facili (1988). Impressed with Carrey&apos;s lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).Following his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey&apos;s transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ace Ventura - L&apos;acchiappanimali (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character&apos;s trademark was talking out his derriÃ¨re). Next up was the manic superhero movie The Mask - Da zero a mito (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey&apos;s features could stretch.Finally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers&apos; Scemo &amp; piÃ¹ scemo (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Forever (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ace Ventura - Missione Africa (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in Il rompiscatole (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit Bugiardo bugiardo (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.In 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir&apos;s The Truman Show (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn&apos;t materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman&apos;s bongo drums, which he&apos;d used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.An indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Io, me &amp; Irene (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (RenÃ©e Zellweger). Carrey&apos;s real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard&apos;s Il Grinch (2000).Although Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Una settimana da Dio (2003) and I pinguini di Mr. Popper (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Se mi lasci ti cancello (2004) and the drama/comedy Una parola puÃ² cambiare tutto - Yes Man (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in L&apos;incredibile Burt Wonderstone (2013).Carrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Considered to be one of the most pivotal stars of the early days of Hollywood, Charlie Chaplin lived an interesting life both in his films and behind the camera. He is most recognized as an icon of the silent film era, often associated with his popular character, the Little Tramp; the man with the toothbrush mustache, bowler hat, bamboo cane, and a funny walk.Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in Walworth, London, England on April 16, 1889, to Hannah Harriet Pedlingham (Hill) and Charles Chaplin, both music hall performers, who were married on June 22, 1885. After Charles Sr. separated from Hannah to perform in New York City, Hannah then tried to resurrect her stage career. Unfortunately, her singing voice had a tendency to break at unexpected moments. When this happened, the stage manager spotted young Charlie standing in the wings and led him on stage, where five-year-old Charlie began to sing a popular tune. Charlie and his half-brother, Syd Chaplin spent their lives in and out of charity homes and workhouses between their mother&apos;s bouts of insanity. Hannah was committed to Cane Hill Asylum in May 1903 and lived there until 1921, when Chaplin moved her to California.Chaplin began his official acting career at the age of eight, touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads. At age 18, he began touring with Fred Karno&apos;s vaudeville troupe, joining them on the troupe&apos;s 1910 United States tour. He traveled west to California in December 1913 and signed on with Keystone Studios&apos; popular comedy director Mack Sennett, who had seen Chaplin perform on stage in New York. Charlie soon wrote his brother Syd, asking him to become his manager. While at Keystone, Chaplin appeared in and directed 35 films, starring as the Little Tramp in nearly all.In November 1914, he left Keystone and signed on at Essanay, where he made 15 films. In 1916, he signed on at Mutual and made 12 films. In June 1917, Chaplin signed up with First National Studios, after which he built Chaplin Studios. In 1919, he and Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith formed United Artists (UA).Chaplin&apos;s life and career was full of scandal and controversy. His first big scandal was during World War I, during which time his loyalty to England, his home country, was questioned. He had never applied for American citizenship, but claimed that he was a &quot;paying visitor&quot; to the United States. Many British citizens called Chaplin a coward and a slacker. This and his other career eccentricities sparked suspicion with FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), who believed that he was injecting Communist propaganda into his films. Chaplin&apos;s later film Il grande dittatore (1940), which was his first &quot;talkie&quot;, also created a stir. In the film, Chaplin plays a humorous caricature of Adolf Hitler. Some thought the film was poorly done and in bad taste. However, the film grossed over $5 million and earned five Academy Award Nominations.Another scandal occurred when Chaplin briefly dated 22-year-old Joan Barry. However, Chaplin&apos;s relationship with Barry came to an end in 1942, after a series of harassing actions from her. In May 1943, Barry returned to inform Chaplin that she was pregnant and filed a paternity suit, claiming that the unborn child was his. During the 1944 trial, blood tests proved that Chaplin was not the father, but at the time, blood tests were inadmissible evidence and he was ordered to pay $75 a week until the child turned 21.Chaplin was also scrutinized for his support in aiding the Russian struggle against the invading Nazis during World War II, and the United States government questioned his moral and political views, suspecting him of having Communist ties. For this reason, HUAC subpoenaed him in 1947. However, HUAC finally decided that it was no longer necessary for him to appear for testimony. Conversely, when Chaplin and his family traveled to London for the premier of Luci della ribalta (1952), he was denied re-entry to the United States. In reality, the government had almost no evidence to prove that he was a threat to national security. Instead, he and his wife decided to settle in Switzerland.Chaplin was married four times and had a total of 11 children. In 1918, he married Mildred Harris and they had a son together, Norman Spencer Chaplin, who only lived three days. Chaplin and Mildred were divorced in 1920. He married Lita Grey in 1924, who had two sons, Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. They were divorced in 1927. In 1936, Chaplin married Paulette Goddard and his final marriage was to Oona O&apos;Neill (Oona Chaplin), daughter of playwright Eugene O&apos;Neill in 1943. Oona gave birth to eight children: Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Chaplin, Josephine Chaplin, Victoria Chaplin, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin, Annette-Emilie Chaplin and Christopher Chaplin.In contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a great deal. He also had an &quot;un-millionaire&quot; way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations. In 1921, Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker, and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972, he was honored with an Academy Award for his &quot;incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century.&quot; He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Years Honours List. No formal reason for the honour was listed. The citation simply reads &quot;Charles Spencer Chaplin, Film Actor and Producer&quot;.Chaplin&apos;s other works included musical scores he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, &quot;My Autobiography&quot; (1964) and its companion volume, &quot;My Life in Pictures&quot; (1974).Chaplin died at age 88 of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His funeral was a small and private Anglican ceremony according to his wishes. In 1978, Chaplin&apos;s corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement.Six of Chaplin&apos;s films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917), Il monello (1921) , La febbre dell&apos;oro (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936) and The Great Dictator (1940).Charlie Chaplin was considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world, and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp&apos;s positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">George Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (nÃ©e Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of this youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.After his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small part in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom P/S - Pronto soccorso (1984) as &quot;Dr. Doug Ross&quot;. More roles soon followed, including &quot;George Burnett&quot;, the handsome handyman on L&apos;albero delle mele (1979); &quot;Booker Brooks&quot;, a supervisor on Pappa e ciccia (1988); and &quot;Detective James Falconer&quot; on Sisters (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as &quot;Dr. Doug Ross&quot; on the award-winning drama series, E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle, and Julianna Margulies.While filming &quot;ER&quot;, Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez&apos;s Dal tramonto all&apos;alba (1996), and Un giorno... per caso (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Clooney took on the role of &quot;Batman&quot; in Joel Schumacher&apos;s Batman &amp; Robin (1997). The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Bat suit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh&apos;s Out of Sight (1998), Terrence Malick&apos;s La sottile linea rossa (1998), and David O. Russell&apos;s Three Kings (1999).In 1999, Clooney left &quot;ER&quot; (though he would return for the season finale) and appeared in a number of films, including Fratello, dove sei? (2000), La tempesta perfetta (2000), and Ocean&apos;s Eleven - Fate il vostro gioco (2001). Collaborating once again with Steven Soderbergh, &quot;Ocean&apos;s Eleven&quot; received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels: Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004) and Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007).In 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with Confessioni di una mente pericolosa (2002), an adaptation of TV producer Chuck Barris&apos;s autobiography. This was the first film under the banner of &quot;Section Eight Productions&quot;, a production company he founded with Steven Soderbergh. The company also produced many acclaimed films, including Lontano dal paradiso (2002), Syriana (2005), A Scanner Darkly - Un oscuro scrutare (2006), and Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005). Clooney won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in &quot;Syriana&quot;, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;.In 2006, &quot;Section Eight&quot; was shut down so that Soderbergh could concentrate on directing, and Clooney founded a new production company, &quot;Smokehouse Productions&quot;, with his friend and long-time business partner, Grant Heslov.Clooney went on to produce and star in Michael Clayton (2007) (which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor), directed and starred in In amore niente regole (2008), and took leading roles in Burn After Reading - A prova di spia (2008), L&apos;uomo che fissa le capre (2009), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), and Jason Reitman&apos;s Tra le nuvole (2009). Clooney received critical acclaim for his performance in &quot;Up in the Air&quot; and was nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe and Academy Award. He didn&apos;t win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lay in a coma in Alexander Payne&apos;s Paradiso amaro (2011). Throughout his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the &quot;United Nations Messengers of Peace&quot; since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the &quot;Hope for Haiti&quot; telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake. In March of 2012, Clooney was arrested for civil disobedience while protesting at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C.Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam, from 1989 until 1993. After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again. Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman bet him $10,000 that he would have children by the age of 40, and sent him a check shortly after his birthday. Clooney returned the funds and bet double or nothing he wouldn&apos;t have children by the age of 50. Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler. In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jennifer Connelly was born in the Catskill Mountains, New York, to Ilene (Schuman), a dealer of antiques, and Gerard Connelly, a clothing manufacturer. Her father had Irish and Norwegian ancestry, and her mother was from a Jewish immigrant family. Jennifer grew up in Brooklyn Heights, just across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, except for the four years her parents spent in Woodstock, New York. Back in Brooklyn Heights, she attended St. Ann&apos;s school. A close friend of the family was an advertising executive. When Jennifer was ten, he suggested that her parents take her to a modeling audition. She began appearing in newspaper and magazine ads (among them &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine), and soon moved on to television commercials. A casting director saw her and introduced her to Sergio Leone, who was seeking a young girl to dance in his gangster epic C&apos;era una volta in America (1984). Although having little screen time, the few minutes she was on-screen were enough to reveal her talent. Her next role after that was an episode of the British horror anthology TV series Il brivido dell&apos;imprevisto (1979) in 1984.After Leone&apos;s movie, horror master Dario Argento signed her to play her first starring role in his thriller Phenomena (1985). The film made a lot of money in Europe but, unfortunately, was heavily cut for American distribution. Around the same time, she appeared in the rock video &quot;I Drove All Night,&quot; a Roy Orbison song, co-starring Jason Priestley. She released a single called &quot;Monologue of Love&quot; in Japan in the mid-1980s, in which she sings in Japanese a charming little song with semi-classical instruments arrangement. On the B-side is &quot;Message Of Love,&quot; which is an interview with music in background. She also appeared in television commercials in Japan.She enrolled at Yale, and then transferred two years later to Stanford. She trained in classical theater and improvisation, studying with the late drama coach Roy London, Howard Fine, and Harold Guskin.The late 1980s saw her starring in a hit and three lesser seen films. Amongst the latter was her roles in Etoile (1989), as a ballerina and in Some Girls (1988), where she played a self-absorbed college freshman. The hit was Labyrinth - Dove tutto Ã¨ possibile (1986), released in 1986. Jennifer got the job after a nationwide talent search for the lead in this fantasy directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas. Her career entered in a calm phase after those films, until Dennis Hopper, who was impressed after having seen her in &quot;Some Girls&quot;, cast Jennifer as an ingÃ©nue small-town girl in The Hot Spot - Il posto caldo (1990), based upon the 1950s crime novel &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;. It received mixed critical reviews, but it was not a box office success.Le avventure di Rocketeer (1991), an ambitious Touchstone super-production, came to the rescue. The film was an old-fashioned adventure flick about a man capable of flying with rockets on his back. Critics saw in &quot;Rocketeer&quot; a top-quality movie, a homage to those old films of the 1930s in which the likes of Errol Flynn starred. After &quot;Rocketeer,&quot; Jennifer made Tutto puÃ² accadere (1991), The Heart of Justice (1992), Scomodi omicidi (1996), her first collaboration with Nick Nolte and Innocenza infranta (1997). In 1998, she was invited by director Alex Proyas to make Dark City (1998), a strange, visually stunning science-fiction extravaganza. In this movie, Jennifer played the main character&apos;s wife, and she delivered an acclaimed performance. The film itself didn&apos;t break any box-office record but received positive reviews. This led Jennifer to a contract with Fox for the television series The $treet (2000), a main part in the memorable and dramatic love-story Waking the Dead (2000) and, more important, a breakthrough part in the polemic and applauded independent Requiem for a Dream (2000), a tale about the haunting lives of drug addicts and the subsequent process of decadence and destruction. In &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; Jennifer had her career&apos;s most courageous, difficult part, a performance that earned her a Spirit Award Nomination. She followed this role with Pollock (2000), in which she played Pollock&apos;s mistress, Ruth Klingman. In 2001, Ron Howard chose her to co-star with Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind (2001), the film that tells the true story of John Nash, a man who suffered from mental illness but eventually beats this and wins the Nobel Prize in 1994. Jennifer played Nash&apos;s wife and won a Golden Globe, BAFTA, AFI and Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Connelly continued her career with films including Hulk (2003), her second collaboration with Nick Nolte, Dark Water (2005), Blood Diamond - Diamanti di sangue (2006), Ultimatum alla Terra (2008), La veritÃ  Ã¨ che non gli piaci abbastanza (2009) and Noah (2014), where she did her second collaboration with both Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe and made her third collaboration with Nick Nolte in that same film.Jennifer lives in New York. She is 5&apos;7&quot;, and speaks fluent Italian and French. She enjoys physical activities such as swimming, gymnastics, and bike riding. She is also an outdoors person -- camping, hiking and walking, and is interested in quantum physics and philosophy. She likes horses, Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Jesus Jones, and occasionally wears a small picture of the The Dalai Lama on a necklace. Her favorite colors are cobalt blue, forest green, and &quot;very pale green/gray -- sort of like the color of the sea&quot;. She likes to draw.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The tall, handsome and muscular Scottish actor Sean Connery is best known for being the original actor to portray the character of James Bond in the hugely successful movie franchise, starring in seven films between 1962 and 1983. Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in The Untouchables - Gli intoccabili (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie&apos;s principal star Kevin Costner. Connery has been polled as &quot;The Greatest Living Scot&quot; and &quot;Scotland&apos;s Greatest Living National Treasure&quot;. In 1989, he was proclaimed &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted &quot;Sexiest Man of the Century&quot;.Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. His mother, Euphamia C. Maclean, was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He also has a brother named Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist&apos;s model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves.Club di gangsters (1957) was Sean&apos;s first major movie role, and it was followed by several made-for-TV movies such as ITV Television Playhouse: Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) as well as guest appearances on TV series, and also films such as I piloti dell&apos;inferno (1957), Estasi d&apos;amore - Operazione Love (1958), Darby O&apos;Gill e il re dei folletti (1959) and Scotland Yard sezioni omicidi (1961). In 1962 he appeared in Il giorno piÃ¹ lungo (1962) with a host of other stars.His big breakthrough came in 1962 when he landed the role of secret agent James Bond in Agente 007 - Licenza di uccidere (1962). He played James Bond in six more films: A 007, dalla Russia con amore (1963), Agente 007 - Missione Goldfinger (1964), Agente 007 - Thunderball: operazione tuono (1965), Agente 007 - Si vive solo due volte (1967), Agente 007 - Una cascata di diamanti (1971) and Mai dire mai (1983).After and during the success of the Bond films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Marnie (1964), La collina del disonore (1965), Assassinio sull&apos;Orient Express (1974), L&apos;uomo che volle farsi re (1975), Il vento e il leone (1975), I banditi del tempo (1981), Highlander - L&apos;ultimo immortale (1986), Il nome della rosa (1986), Indiana Jones e l&apos;ultima crociata (1989), Caccia a Ottobre Rosso (1990), Sol levante (1993), The Rock (1996), Scoprendo Forrester (2000) and La leggenda degli uomini straordinari (2003).Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963. The couple separated in February 1971 and divorced 2Â½ years later. Sean then dated Jill St. John, Lana Wood, Magda Konopka and Carole Mallory. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, despite Sean&apos;s well-documented love affair with Lynsey de Paul in the late &apos;80s. Sean has three stepchildren through his marriage to Micheline. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Connery, in 1997.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kevin Michael Costner was born on January 18, 1955 in Lynwood, California, the third child of Bill Costner, a ditch digger and ultimately an electric line servicer for Southern California Edison, and Sharon Costner (nÃ©e Tedrick), a welfare worker. His older brother, Dan, was born in 1950. A middle brother died at birth in 1953. His father&apos;s job required him to move regularly, which caused Kevin to feel like an Army kid, always the new kid at school, which led to him being a daydreamer. As a teen, he sang in the Baptist church choir, wrote poetry, and took writing classes. At 18, he built his own canoe and paddled his way down the rivers that Lewis &amp; Clark followed to the Pacific. Despite his present height, he was only 5&apos;2&quot; when he graduated high school. Nonetheless, he still managed to be a basketball, football and baseball star. In 1973, he enrolled at California State University at Fullerton, where he majored in business. During that period, Kevin decided to take acting lessons five nights a week. He graduated with a business degree in 1978 and married his college sweetheart, Cindy Costner. He initially took a marketing job in Orange County. Everything changed when he accidentally met Richard Burton on a flight from Mexico. Burton advised him to go completely after acting if that is what he wanted. He quit his job and moved to Hollywood soon after. He drove a truck, worked on a deep sea fishing boat, and gave bus tours to stars&apos; homes before finally making his own way into the films. After making one soft core sex film, he vowed to not work again if that was the only work he could do. He didn&apos;t work for nearly six years, while he waited for a proper break. That break came with Il grande freddo (1983), even though his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor -- he was remembered by director Lawrence Kasdan when he decided to make Silverado (1985). Costner&apos;s career took off after that.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wes Craven has become synonymous with genre bending and innovative horror, challenging audiences with his bold vision.Wesley Earl Craven was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Caroline (Miller) and Paul Eugene Craven. He had a midwestern suburban upbringing. His first feature film was L&apos;ultima casa a sinistra (1972), which he wrote, directed, and edited. Craven reinvented the youth horror genre again in 1984 with the classic Nightmare - Dal profondo della notte (1984), a film he wrote and directed. And though he did not direct any of its five sequels, he deconstructed the genre a decade later, writing and directing the audacious Nightmare - Nuovo incubo (1994), which was nominated as Best Feature at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards, and introduced the concept of self-reflexive genre films to the world. In 1996 Craven reached a new level of success with the release of Scream (1996). The film, which sparked the phenomenal trilogy, was the winner of MTV&apos;s 1996 Best Movie Award and grossed more than $100 million domestically, as did Scream 2 (1997). Between Scream 2 and Scream 3 (2000), Craven, offered the opportunity to direct a non-genre film for Miramax, helmed La musica del cuore (1999), a film that earned Meryl Streep an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. That same year, in the midst of directing, Craven completed his first novel, &quot;The Fountain Society,&quot; published by Simon &amp; Shuster. Recent works include the 2005 psychological thriller Red Eye (2005), and a short rom-com segment for the ensemble product, Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006). Over the last few years, Craven has also produced remakes of two of his earlier films for his genre fans, The Hills Have Eyes (2006) and The Last House on the Left (2009). Craven has always had an eye for discovering fresh talent, something that contributes to the success of his films. While casting A Nightmare on Elm Street, Craven discovered the then unknown Johnny Depp. Craven later cast Sharon Stone in her first starring role for his film Deadly Blessing. He even gave Bruce Willis his first featured role in an episode of TV&apos;s mid-80&apos;s edition of The Twilight Zone. In My Soul to Take - Il cacciatore di anime (2010), Craven once again brought together a cast of up-and-coming young teens, including Max Thieriot, in whom he saw the spark of stardom. The film marked Craven&apos;s first collaboration with wife and producer Iya Labunka, who also produced with him the highly anticipated production of Scream 4. Craven&apos;s most recent film, Scream 4 (2011) reunites the director with Dimension Films and Kevin Williamson, as well as with stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, to re-boot the beloved franchise. Craven again exhibits his knack for spotting important talent, with a cast of young actors bringing us a totally new breed of Woodsboro high schoolers, including Emma Robert and Hayden Pannetierre.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Russell Ira Crowe was born in Wellington, New Zealand, to Jocelyn Yvonne (Wemyss) and John Alexander Crowe, both of whom catered movie sets. His maternal grandfather, Stanley Wemyss, was a cinematographer. Crowe&apos;s recent ancestry includes Welsh (where his paternal grandfather was born, in Wrexham), English, Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, and Maori (one of Crowe&apos;s maternal great-grandmothers, Erana Putiputi Hayes Heihi, was Maori).Crowe&apos;s family moved to Australia when he was a small child, settling in Sydney, and Russell got the acting bug early in life. Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell&apos;s first big break came with two films ... the first, Skinheads (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, Tutto ciÃ² che siamo (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Skinheads (1992) and wanted him for her film, Pronti a morire (1995). But filming on Tutto ciÃ² che siamo (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With Pronti a morire (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuality (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuality (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers. L.A. Confidential (1997), Russell&apos;s third American film, brought him the US fame and attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the Oscar nod this time around, he didn&apos;t seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The Walt Disney Company, Mistery, Alaska (1999). He achieved even more success and awards for his performances in Il gladiatore (2000), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and A Beautiful Mind (2001).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Amore senza fine (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); Il colore dei soldi (1986), Rain Man - L&apos;uomo della pioggia (1988) and Nato il quattro luglio (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Intervista col vampiro (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire (1996), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Tom Cruise&apos;s biggest franchise, Mission Impossible, has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing, with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise.In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1966-06-28</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Cusack is, like most of his characters, an unconventional hero. Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (nÃ©e Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John&apos;s siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago&apos;s Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall&apos;s geek brigade in Sixteen Candles - Un compleanno da ricordare (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like Sacco a pelo a tre piazze (1985) and Sapore di hamburger (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Non per soldi... ma per amore (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in Rischiose abitudini (1990).The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins&apos; Actors&apos; Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack&apos;s high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime&apos;s first feature was the sharply written comedy L&apos;ultimo contratto (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film&apos;s financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack&apos;s next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, &quot;the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals&quot;) in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood&apos;s Mezzanotte nel giardino del bene e del male (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case.Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Essere John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in Alta fedeltÃ  (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby&apos;s popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his &quot;Top 5&quot; breakups to find out why he&apos;s so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He&apos;s also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn&apos;t reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a &quot;great piece of art&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As a child, Geena dreamed of being an actress. While in high school, she felt left out and had low self-esteem because, at 6 feet, she was the tallest girl in school. After high school graduation, Geena entered New England College in New Hampshire and then transferred the next year to Boston University, where she majored in drama. In 1977, she graduated and moved to New York to start her career. Her career consisted of sales clerk and waitress. She worked at Ann Taylor, where she eventually rose to Saturday window mannequin while trying to get a job with a modeling agency. Eventually signed by the Zoli Agency, she wound up as a model in the Victoria Secret&apos;s Catalogue. Ever vigilant, Sydney Pollack was looking for new talent in the catalog when he spotted Geena and cast her in Tootsie (1982). With good reviews, Geena moved to Los Angeles where she was cast as Wendy in the short-lived but critically acclaimed television series Buffalo Bill (1983) with Dabney Coleman. A starter marriage to restaurant manager Richard Emmolo dissolved around this time. Her next appearance on television was in her own series Sara (1985), which was also good, but soon canceled. Geena then returned to the big screen in the below-average Una notte in Transilvania (1985) followed by the successful Chevy Chase movie Fletch - Un colpo da prima pagina (1985). From there on, she was on a roll with second husband Jeff Goldblum in the horror remake La mosca (1986). More successful were Tim Burton&apos;s dark comedy Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988) and Turista per caso (1988). For the last film, she was the surprise winner of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. More fun movies followed with the flying-saucer-in-the-pool Le ragazze della Terra sono facili (1988) and everyone-loves-a-clown Scappiamo col malloppo (1990) with Bill Murray. The very successful Thelma &amp; Louise (1991), directed by Ridley Scott, again garnered nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe. Ragazze vincenti (1992), with Tom Hanks and directed by Penny Marshall, was the turning point as her next film, Eroe per caso (1992), was only average. Then she married director Renny Harlin and they set up a production and development company called &quot;The Forge&quot;. Their first film was Ciao Julia, sono Kevin (1994), which flopped at the box office. Undeterred, Renny decided to film the big-budget Corsari (1995), starring Geena as pirate leader Morgan, which also flopped. Geena has since starred in the thriller Spy (1996) and played Eleanor Little in Stuart Little - Un topolino in gamba (1999) and Stuart Little 2 (2002). She&apos;s also returned to TV, headlining The Geena Davis Show (2000) and Commander in Chief (2005). Both shows were canceled after one season each, but she won a Golden Globe for the latter. Since 2001 she has been married to her fourth husband, neurosurgeon Reza Jarrahy, and they have three children. In 2008, after being missed from the big screen for some years, Geena ventured to Sydney, Australia, playing the foul-mouthed mother of Harry Cook and Harrison Gilbertson to shoot the dark comedy Accidents Happen (2009).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">His birth occurred on Friday, December 31st, 1943, as the son of an Air Force officer, Denver was constantly moved from state to state and country to country. It was in Tucson, Arizona, that his grandmother gave him his first acoustic guitar, a gift that would prove an icebreaker when meeting other students at the many new schools in which he was placed. After settling with his family in Fort Worth, Texas, Denver ran away to California for a short time. He returned to Texas and graduated from high school, but soon returned to California on a more permanent basis. He began performing at Leadbetter&apos;s night club in West Los Angeles but had a major career breakthrough when he was selected to replace the departing Chad Mitchell of The Chad Mitchell Trio. He remained with that organization until 1968 when he struck out on his own. From 1969 through 1975, Denver was the top-selling recording artist, appearing on both country and pop charts alike. His peak year was 1975, during which he was awarded the Country Music Association&apos;s Entertainer of the Year in addition to being selected as the American Guild of Variety Artists&apos; Singing Star of the Year. During this period, he tried his hand at acting, appearing as Deputy Dewey Cobb in a 1973 episode of Uno sceriffo a New York (1970) and hosting Denver in Colorado (1974), an ecologically-minded television special. His most memorable role came in 1977 when he starred opposite George Burns in the hit comedy, Bentornato Dio! (1977). Following this, his record sales began to decline, and he made fewer movies and television specials. He became something of a political activist, with his main focus being on environmental issues. He was killed on Sunday, October 12th, 1997, (505 years after Christopher Columbus&apos; discovery of North America) when the plane he was piloting crashed into Monterey Bay. John Denver&apos;s lifetime: 19,616 days (2,802 weeks &amp; 2 days).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in Hollywood.He was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963, to Betty Sue (Wells), who worked as a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer.Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named &apos;The Kids&apos;. When he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp&apos;s film debut in the low-budget horror film, Nightmare - Dal profondo della notte (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987).In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward mani di forbice (1990). Following the film&apos;s success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Paura e delirio a Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut&apos;s Wife - La moglie dell&apos;astronauta (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Il mistero di Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in La vera storia di Jack lo Squartatore (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez&apos;s &quot;mariachi&quot; trilogy, C&apos;era una volta in Messico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster La maledizione della prima luna (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film&apos;s enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Neverland - Un sogno per la vita (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl&apos;s novel, La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005), and later in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012).Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss.

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1974-11-11</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Genitori in blue jeans (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeo + Giulietta di William Shakespeare (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (nÃ©e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, &quot;Wilhelm&quot;, was his maternal grandfather&apos;s first name. Leonardo&apos;s father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late &apos;Harvey Pekar&apos;, a friend of George&apos;s. Leonardo&apos;s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name &quot;Lenny Williams&quot;, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Pappa e ciccia (1988) and Lassie (1989), but it wasn&apos;t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio&apos;s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Genitori in blue jeans (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the &quot;Cousin Oliver&quot; role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio&apos;s stint on Genitori in blue jeans (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public&apos;s attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in Buon compleanno Mr. Grape (1993), a young gunslinger in Pronti a morire (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in Ritorno dal nulla (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo&apos;s reputation as an actor, it wasn&apos;t until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann&apos;s Romeo + Giulietta di William Shakespeare (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio&apos;s reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in La maschera di ferro (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Prova a prendermi (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan&apos;s Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clichÃ© about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in Il grande Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A tall, strikingly attractive blue-eyed natural blonde, Cameron Diaz was born in 1972 in San Diego, the daughter of a Cuban-American father and a German mother. Self described as &quot;adventurous, independent and a tough kid,&quot; Cameron left home at 16 and for the next 5 years lived in such varied locales as Japan, Australia, Mexico, Morocco, and Paris. Returning to California at the age of 21, she was working as a model when she auditioned for a big part in The Mask - Da zero a mito (1994). To her amazement and despite having no previous acting experience, she was cast as the female lead in the film opposite Jim Carrey. Over the next 3 years, she honed her acting skills in such low budget independent films as Una cena quasi perfetta (1995); Due mariti per un matrimonio (1996); and Acque profonde (1996). She returned to main stream films in Il matrimonio del mio migliore amico (1997), in which she held her own against veteran actress Julia Roberts. She earned full fledged star status in 1998 for her performance in the box office smash Tutti pazzi per Mary (1998). With her name near the top on virtually every list of Hollyood&apos;s sexiest actresses, and firmly established as one of filmdom&apos;s hottest properties and most sought after actresses, Cameron Diaz appears to possess everything necessary to become one of the super stars of the new century.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1944-09-25</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An actor with over forty years of experience in theatre, film, and television, Michael Douglas branched out into independent feature production in 1975 with the Academy Award-winning Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975). Since then, as a producer and as an actor-producer, he has shown an uncanny knack for choosing projects that reflect changing trends and public concerns. Over the years, he has been involved in such controversial and politically influential motion pictures as Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975), Sindrome cinese (1979) and Traffic (2000), and such popular films as Attrazione fatale (1987) and All&apos;inseguimento della pietra verde (1984).Michael Douglas was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to actors Diana Douglas (Diana Love Dill) and Kirk Douglas (born Issur Danielovitch). His paternal grandparents were Belarusian Jewish immigrants, while his mother was born in Bermuda, the daughter of a local Attorney General, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Melville Dill; Diana&apos;s family had long been established in both Bermuda and the United States. Douglas&apos;s parents divorced when he was six, and he went to live with his mother and her new husband. Only seeing Kirk on holidays, Michael attended Eaglebrook school in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he was about a year younger than all of his classmates.Douglas attended the elite preparatory Choate School and spent his summers with his father on movie sets. Although accepted at Yale, Douglas attended the University of California, Santa Barbara. Deciding he wanted to be an actor in his teenage years, Michael often asked his father about getting a &quot;foot in the door&quot;. Kirk was strongly opposed to Michael pursuing an acting career, saying that it was an industry with many downs and few ups, and that he wanted all four of his sons to stay out of it. Michael, however, was persistent, and made his film debut in his father&apos;s film Combattenti della notte (1966).After receiving his B.A. degree in 1968, Douglas moved to New York City to continue his dramatic training, studying at the American Place Theatre with Wynn Handman, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where he appeared in workshop productions of Pirandello&apos;s Six Characters in Search of an Author (1976) and Thornton Wilder&apos;s Happy Journey (1963). A few months after he arrived in New York, Douglas got his first big break, when he was cast in the pivotal role of the free-spirited scientist who compromises his liberal views to accept a lucrative job with a high-tech chemical corporation in the CBS Playhouse production of Ellen M. Violett&apos;s drama, The Experiment, which was televised nationwide on February 25, 1969.Douglas&apos; convincing portrayal won him the leading role in the adaptation of John Weston&apos;s controversial novel, Hail, Hero! (1969), which was the initial project of CBS&apos;s newly organized theatrical film production company, Cinema Center Films. Douglas starred as a well-meaning, almost saintly young pacifist determined not only to justify his beliefs to his conservative parents but also to test them under fire in the jungles of Indochina. His second feature, Adam at Six A.M. (1970) concerned a young man&apos;s search for his roots. Douglas next appeared in the film version of Ron Cowen&apos;s play Summertree (1971), produced by &apos;Kirk Douglas&apos;&apos; Bryna Company, and then Due ragazzi e... un leone (1972), a sentimental children&apos;s melodrama from the Walt Disney studio.In between film assignments, he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway productions, among them &quot;City Scenes&quot;, Frank Gagliano&apos;s surrealistic vignettes of contemporary life in New York, John Patrick Shanley&apos;s short-lived romance &quot;Love is a Time of Day&quot; and George Tabori&apos;s &quot;Pinkville&quot;, in which he played a young innocent brutalized by his military training. He also appeared in the made-for-television thriller, &quot;When Michael Calls&quot;, broadcast by ABC-TV on February 5, 1972 and in episodes of the popular series &quot;Medical Center&quot; and &quot;The FBI&quot;.Impressed by Douglas&apos; performance in a segment of The F.B.I. (1965), producer &apos;Quinn Martin&apos; signed the actor for the part of Karl Malden&apos;s sidekick in the police series &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, which premiered September of 1972 and became one of ABC&apos;s highest-rated prime-time programs in the mid-1970s. Douglas earned three successive Emmy Award nominations for his performance and he directed two episodes of the series.During the annual breaks in the shooting schedule for The Streets of _San Francisco (1972)_, Douglas devoted most of his time to his film production company, Big Stick Productions, Ltd., which produced several short subjects in the early 1970s. Long interested in producing a film version of Ken Kesey&apos;s grimly humorous novel Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975), Douglas purchased the movie rights from his father and began looking for financial backing. After a number of major motion picture studios turned him down, Douglas formed a partnership with Saul Zaentz, a record industry executive, and the two set about recruiting the cast and crew. Douglas still had a year to go on his contract for &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, but the producers agreed to write his character out of the story so that he could concentrate on filming &quot;Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot;.A critical and commercial success, Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress, and went on to gross more than $180 million at the box office. Douglas suddenly found himself in demand as an independent producer. One of the many scripts submitted to him for consideration was Mike Gray&apos;s chilling account of the attempted cover-up of an accident at a nuclear power plant. Attracted by the combination of social relevance and suspense, Douglas immediately bought the property. Deemed not commercial by most investors, Douglas teamed up with Jane Fonda and her own motion picture production company, IPC Films.A Michael Douglas-IPC Films co-production, Sindrome cinese (1979) starred Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda, and &apos;Michael Douglas&apos; and received Academy Award nominations for Lemmon and Fonda, as well as for Best Screenplay. The National Board of Review named the film one of the best films of the year.Despite his success as a producer, Douglas resumed his acting career in the late 1970s, starring in Michael Crichton&apos;s medical thriller Coma profondo (1978) with Genevieve Bujold, Claudia Weill&apos;s feminist comedy Amarti a New York (1980) starring Jill Clayburgh, and Peter Hyams&apos; gripping tale of modern-day vigilante justice, &quot;The Star Chamber&quot; (1983). Douglas also starred in Running - Il vincitore (1979), as a compulsive quitter who sacrifices everything to take one last shot at the Olympics, and as Zach the dictatorial director/choreographer in Richard Attenborough&apos;s screen version of the Broadway&apos;s longest running musical Chorus Line (1985).Douglas&apos; career as an actor/producer came together again in 1984 with the release of the tongue-in-cheek romantic fantasy &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. Douglas had begun developing the project several years earlier, and with Kathleen Turner as Joan Wilder, the dowdy writer of gothic romances, Danny DeVito as the feisty comic foil Ralphie and Douglas as Jack Colton, the reluctant soldier of fortune, &quot;Romancing&quot; was a resounding hit and grossed more than $100 million at the box office. Douglas was named Producer of the Year in 1984 by the National Association of Theater Owners. Douglas, Turner and DeVito reteamed in 1985 for the successful sequel Il gioiello del Nilo (1985).It took Douglas nearly two years to convince Columbia Pictures executives to approve the production of Starman (1984), an unlikely tale of romance between an extraterrestrial, played by &apos;Jeff Bridges&apos;, and a young widow, played by Karen Allen. Starman (1984) was the sleeper hit of the 1984 Christmas season and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for &apos;Jeff Bridges&apos;. In 1986 Douglas created a television series based on the film for ABC which starred &apos;Robert Hays&apos;.After a lengthy break from acting, Douglas returned to the screen in 1987 appearing in two of the year&apos;s biggest hits. He starred opposite Glenn Close in the phenomenally successful psychological thriller, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, which was followed by his performance as ruthless corporate raider Gordon Gekko in &apos;Oliver Stone&apos;&apos;s Wall Street (1987), earning him the Academy Award for Best Actor.Douglas next starred in Ridley Scott&apos;s thriller Black Rain - Pioggia sporca (1989) and then teamed up again with &apos;Kathleen Turner&apos; and Danny DeVito in the black comedy La guerra dei Roses (1989) which was released in 1989.In 1988 Douglas formed Stonebridge Entertainment, Inc. which produced Linea mortale (1990), directed by Joel Schumacher and starred Kiefer Sutherland, &apos;Julia Roberts&apos;, &apos;Kevin Bacon&apos; and &apos;William Baldwin&apos; and Il grande volo (1992) starring Lorraine Bracco and directed by Richard Donner. Douglas followed with David Seltzer&apos;s adaptation of Susan Issac&apos;s best-selling novel, &quot;Shining Through&quot;, opposite Melanie Griffith. In 1992 he starred with Sharon Stone in the erotic thriller from &apos;Paul Verhoeven&apos; Basic Instinct (1992), one of the year&apos;s top grossing films.Douglas gave one of his most powerful performances opposite Robert Duvall in Joel Schumacher&apos;s controversial drama Un giorno di ordinaria follia (1993).

In 1994/95 he starred with Demi Moore in Barry Levinson&apos;s &quot;Disclosure,.&quot; based on the best seller by Michael Crichton.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David William Duchovny was born on August 7, 1960, in New York City, New York, USA. His father, Amram Ducovny, was a writer and publicist who was from a family of Jewish immigrants (from Ukraine and Poland), and worked for the American Jewish Committee. His mother, Margaret (Miller), was a Scottish-born school teacher. David has a sister, Laurie, and an older brother, Daniel Ducovny, an award-winning director of commercials, as well as a director of photography.David earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton University, and also attended Yale University, where he undertook a Master&apos;s Degree in English Literature. A keen poet and writer, David&apos;s work was well recognized by his peers and teachers while he was in attendance at Yale. He was even nominated for a college prize by the Academy of American Poets for his outstanding work within the literary field. While at Yale, he began commuting to New York to study acting and was soon appearing in off-Broadway plays. In 1987, he abandoned his doctoral studies at Yale to pursue acting full time.Like any actor or celebrity, David began his career on the bottom, by acting in numerous commercials in the late-eighties. He crossed over into films with bit parts in low key films such as Le prime immagini dell&apos;anno nuovo (1989) and Cattive compagnie (1990). Although these parts were small and somewhat insignificant, it was a start and David was able to get his foot in the door.In 1991, David got offered the role of DEA Dennis Bryson on the acclaimed TV series, I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990). He only appeared in three episodes, but at that early stage, it was his biggest claim to fame yet, as I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990) was watched by millions of people worldwide. Needless to say, David&apos;s talents as an actor would finally be recognized and he would get the acknowledgment that he so richly deserved.In the early 1990s, he got more bit parts in films, this time, however, the films weren&apos;t &quot;low key&quot;, but hits, such as ...Non dite a mamma che la babysitter Ã¨ morta! (1991) and the family favorite comedy, Beethoven (1992). David&apos;s role in Beethoven (1992) was small, but it was hard to forget the poor guy who was dragged across the lawn by the giant St. Bernard!A year later, in 1993, David got the lead role in the independent film Kalifornia (1993). The film also starred another up-and-coming young actor, Brad Pitt. In Kalifornia (1993), David played a journalist who goes on a cross-country tour of famous murder sites with his girlfriend as research for a book he is writing about serial killers. He takes Pitt&apos;s character along to help pay the bills, unaware that Pitt&apos;s character is in fact a serial killer himself. Although it did not do much business at the box office, it is still a great film and has become somewhat of a cult favorite among fans.That same year, David was offered the role of FBI Agent Fox &quot;Spooky&quot; Mulder on the long-running TV series X-Files (1993). The show was a tremendous international success and propelled David (and his co-star Gillian Anderson) into super-stardom. His character of Mulder has become somewhat of a pop culture legend and is renowned the world over for his satirical wit and dry sense of humor. Fans loved the fact that he could keep a straight face and still crack and joke in the face of extreme danger. David improvised a lot of his own lines of dialogue while on the show and even penned and directed a few episodes. The series ended in 2002 and still has a strong, dedicated following. To date, David has reprised his role of Fox Mulder in two &quot;X Files&quot; feature films: X-Files - Il film (1998) and X-Files: Voglio crederci (2008).During the initial run of X-Files (1993), David kept busy and made several films, such as: Return to Me (2000), alongside actress Minnie Driver and the comedy favorite Evolution (2001), with Julianne Moore, Seann William Scott and Orlando Jones. He even had a hysterical cameo as a self-obsessed, simple-minded hand model in the comedy-smash Zoolander (2001).In 2007, after a few years out of the limelight, David struck gold again after landing the plum role of Hank Moody in Californication (2007). The raunchy series follows the life of womanizing writer Hank Moody (Duchovny) as he tries to juggle his career and his relationship with his daughter and his ex-girlfriend. The show has become a hit for its off-the-wall humor and Duchovny&apos;s ability to always turn in a brilliant performance.It may have taken a while, but David has worked his way to the top and notched up an impressive resume along the way. We can expect to see a lot more of him in the future.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Clint Eastwood was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood, a housewife turned IBM operator. He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. When Eastwood was 19, his parents relocated to Washington state, and young Clint spent a couple years working menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest. Returning to California in 1951, he did a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. During the mid-&apos;50s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as La vendetta del mostro (1955) and Tarantola (1955) while simultaneously digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Gli uomini della prateria (1959) with Eric Fleming. Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood&apos;s big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone&apos;s trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: Per un pugno di dollari (1964), Per qualche dollaro in piÃ¹ (1965), and Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice for Clint&apos;s character, finally getting American distribution in 1967/68. As the last film racked up phenomenal grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from television nonentity to sought-after box office attraction in just a matter of months. Yet again a success was the late-blooming star&apos;s first U.S.-made western, Impiccalo piÃ¹ in alto (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in L&apos;uomo dalla cravatta di cuoio (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series Uno sceriffo a New York (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Dove osano le aquile (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical La ballata della cittÃ  senza nome (1969). In Gli avvoltoi hanno fame (1970) and I guerrieri (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a predatory Union soldier in La notte brava del soldato Jonathan (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Brivido nella notte (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Ispettore Callaghan: il caso &apos;Scorpio&apos; Ã¨ tuo!! (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), Lo straniero senza nome (1973) and Il texano dagli occhi di ghiaccio (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Una 44 magnum per l&apos;ispettore Callaghan (1973) and Cielo di piombo, ispettore Callaghan (1976), the road adventures Una calibro 20 per lo specialista (1974) and L&apos;uomo nel mirino (1977), and the fact-based prison film Fuga da Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Filo da torcere (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, Assassinio sull&apos;Eiger (1975) notwithstanding, the &apos;70s were uninterrupted success for Clint.Eastwood kicked off the &apos;80s with Fai come ti pare (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Coraggio... fatti ammazzare (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: &quot;Make my day.&quot; Clint also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox - Volpe di fuoco (1982), Corda tesa (1984), Per piacere... non salvarmi piÃ¹ la vita (1984), Il cavaliere pallido (1985) and Gunny (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, Scommessa con la morte (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and La recluta (1990), it seemed Eastwood&apos;s star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing Cacciatore bianco, cuore nero (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).Eastwood bounced back--big time--with his dark western Gli spietati (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in Nel centro del mirino (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received Un mondo perfetto (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next up was a love story, I ponti di Madison County (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Potere assoluto (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while Fino a prova contraria (1999) and Debito di sangue (2002) were received badly, as was Mezzanotte nel giardino del bene e del male (1997), which he directed but didn&apos;t appear in.Eastwood surprised yet again in the mid-&apos;00s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. Eastwood&apos;s next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Di nuovo in gioco (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood &amp; Company (2012). And between screen appearances, Clint chalked up a long and impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Lettere da Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Changeling (2008) (a vehicle for screen megastar Angelina Jolie), Invictus - L&apos;invincibile (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014&apos;s top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and Ore 15:17 - Attacco al treno (2018). His latest project, in which he stars as an unlikely drug courier, is Il corriere - The Mule (2018), and after that he&apos;ll direct Richard Jewell (2019).Outside of work, Eastwood has led a hysterically convoluted existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His large number of partners and children are now reported matter-of-factly, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The Hollywood kingpin refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a long time relationship with equally enigmatic co-star Locke (deceased 2018), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however -- with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.Eastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Burney (in northern California), Idaho&apos;s Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.</rdfs:comment>

She is the eldest daughter in a family of four girls and one boy. Erika began her acting career at the age of 10, starring in numerous productions for television, film, commercials and theater. Her first film role was in the science fiction blockbuster E.T. - L&apos;extra-terrestre (1982), by Steven Spielberg. Her film credit given was &quot;Pretty Girl&quot;. Erika was spotted by a talent scout working for Steven Spielberg in a performer&apos;s audition showcase. Erika&apos;s mother was very determined for Erika to have a normal childhood and finish school, so Erika worked a couple of jobs a year throughout childhood and adolescence, until after graduating high school.It was directly after this, that Erika joined the original cast of the television series Baywatch (1989) and stayed there for the first two years. Erika decided to leave the series after it changed direction. She wanted to venture out into other avenues and so began a successful film career. Erika starred in such films as Trappola in alto mare (1992), A Beverly Hills... signori si diventa (1993), Una bionda sotto scorta (1994), Giorni di fuoco (1995), Il piacere del sangue (1996), among many others. Erika did a film called Snowbound (2001) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where she met and fell in love with Roch Daigle, a film technician. While Erika lived in Calgary, she did many independent films and cable movies, including some for Lifetime.Erika has dual citizenship with the United States and Canada. After six years, she and Roch split up and Erika moved back home to the United States with Indyanna. Erika has come home to be with her family and surround her young daughter, Indyanna, with loved ones. Erika resides in the Greater Los Angeles area and is working very hard on her career. She is more focused and ready to work than ever before.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cary Elwes was born in Westminster, London, England, the third son of interior designer/shipping heiress Tessa Georgina Kennedy and the late portrait painter Bede Evelyn Dominick Elwes. He is the brother of producer/agent Cassian Elwes and artist Damian Elwes. He was raised in London and attended Harrow. After graduating from Harrow, he moved to the US and studied drama at Sarah Lawrence College. He left school after two years to begin his film career. Cary is well respected by colleagues and fans alike and considered by many to be one of the finest actors working today. He is interested in history and says, &quot;It&apos;s deliberate that a lot of my films have been period pieces&quot;. He is politically active for causes he believes in, such as protecting the environment and helping Native American people.Elwes is married to Lisa Marie Kurbikoff, a stills photographer. He comes from a long-established recusant English family on his father&apos;s side. Several prominent Catholic clerics are among his relatives, including Fr. Luke Cary-Elwes, Dom Columba Cary-Elwes, and Dom Cuthbert Cary-Elwes. His grandfather was society painter and war artist Simon Elwes. Cary (the surname &quot;Cary-Elwes&quot; was shortened to &quot;Elwes&quot; in some branches of the family) was an altar boy at London&apos;s Brompton Oratory, although he did not attend a Catholic high school. From his maternal grandmother, Daska Marija Ivanovic-Banac, who was born in Osijek in the Austra-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), he has Croatian Jewish and Serbian ancestry. Cary&apos;s other lineage is English, Irish, and Scottish.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The sultry, versatile, petite (5&apos; 4&quot;) beauty Sherilyn Fenn was born Sheryl Ann Fenn in Detroit, Michigan, into a family of musicians. The youngest of three children, her mother, Arlene Quatro, played keyboard in rock bands, her aunt is rock-star Suzi Quatro, and her grandfather, Art Quatro, was a jazz musician. Her father, Leo Fenn, was the manager of such bands as The Pleasure Seekers (the all-girl band formed by the Quatro sisters), Alice Cooper, and The Billion Dollar Babies. Sherilyn&apos;s ancestry includes Irish, Italian, Hungarian, German, and Bohemian Czech.Sherilyn traveled a lot with her divorced mother and two older brothers before the family settled in Los Angeles when she was seventeen. Fenn, who says herself she&apos;s demure didn&apos;t want to start with a new school again and soon enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.Fenn began her career with a number of B-movies including The Wild Life (1984) (alongside Chris Penn), skater film Corsa al massacro (1986) (opposite Josh Brolin) and teen-fantasy movie Il replicante (1986) (opposite Charlie Sheen). She had a memorable part in the cult teen-comedy Un ragazzo come gli altri (1985) in which she tries to seduce a teenage girl disguised as a boy, played by Joyce Hyser. Fenn landed her first starring role, as an engaged heiress to an old Southern family experiencing her sexual awakening in Zalman King&apos;s erotic drama film Congiunzione di due lune (1988), after which she said she wanted to hide for a year. Fenn won her most outstanding role and made an indelible impression on the public when she was cast by David Lynch and Mark Frost as the tantalizing Audrey Horne, the high-school femme fatale from the critically acclaimed TV series I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990). The series ran from 1990 to 1991, and the character of Audrey was one of the most popular with fans, in particular for her unrequited love for FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) and her style from the &apos;50s (with her saddle shoes, plaid skirts and tight sweaters). Sherilyn made a memorable impression as the cherry stem-twisting siren. This was her breakout role; even now she says of her I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990) experience: &quot;It still makes me feel kind of proud and special to be part of something like that&quot;. In the show&apos;s second season, when the idea of pairing Audrey and Cooper was abandoned, Audrey was paired with other characters like Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and John Justice Wheeler (Billy Zane). Sherilyn hit cult status when Lynch filmed her dancing on Angelo Badalamenti&apos;s music and with another memorable scene in which her character knotted a cherry stem with her tongue.Shortly after shooting Twin Peaks&apos; pilot episode, David Lynch gave her a small but impressive part in Cuore selvaggio (1990), as a girl injured in a car wreck, obsessed by the contents of her purse, opposite Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. According to Fenn, the turning point in her career was when she met veteran acting coach Roy London in 1990. She credits him with instilling confidence and newfound enthusiasm.After two nominations (Emmy and Golden Globe) and covers for Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines, Fenn was propelled to stardom and became a major sex symbol. She was chosen as one of People magazine&apos;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot;, was named one of the &quot;10 Most Beautiful Women in the World&quot; by Us magazine, and one of the &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; by FHM magazine. Fenn&apos;s classic looks - with her lily-white skin, vertiginous boomerang eyebrows, beauty mark next to her left eye and topaz eyes - were highlighted by renowned photographers like George Hurrell Sr., Steven Meisel, and Bettina Rheims, and led her to be compared to the ones like Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner. Fenn has had an eclectic career with a significant body of work following I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990). She chose to focus on widening her range of roles and was determined to avoid typecasting. She turned down the Audrey Horne spin-off series that was offered to her, and unlike most of the cast, chose not to return for the 1992 prequel movie Fuoco cammina con me (1992), as she was then shooting Uomini e topi (1992). She proved her mettle as an actress with varied roles in neo-noir black comedy Desiderio e passione al Sunset Motel (1991) (as a sultry femme fatale, opposite Whip Hubley and David Hewlett), huis-clos Diario di un killer (1991) (the directorial debut of her acting coach Roy London, in which she plays a fragile mother who confronts hitman Forest Whitaker), John Mackenzie&apos;s fictionalized biopic Ruby - Il terzo uomo a Dallas (1992), (as stripper Sheryl Ann DuJean, a Marilyn Monroe look-alike fictional character, who is a composite of several real-life women from Jack Ruby and president John Kennedy&apos;s entourage; opposite &apos;Danny Aiello&apos; and Arliss Howard), romantic comedy Tre di cuori (1993) (as Kelly Lynch and William Baldwin&apos;s love interest), Carl Reiner&apos;s 1940s detective parody Fatal Instinct - Prossima apertura (1993) (as Armand Assante&apos;s lovesick secretary and Sean Young and Kate Nelligan&apos;s rival) and Showtime&apos;s biblical Slave of Dreams (1995), directed by Robert M. Young (as Potiphar&apos;s seductive wife Zulaikha, opposite Adrian Pasdar and Edward James Olmos, and produced by Dino De Laurentiis).A highlight of Fenn&apos;s film career is Gary Sinise&apos;s film adaptation of Uomini e topi (1992), in which she brought nuance to the role of a seductive and lonely country wife, desperately in need to talk to somebody, opposite Sinise and John Malkovich. In 1993, Fenn teamed up with David Lynch&apos;s daughter Jennifer Lynch and starred in her directorial debut Boxing Helena (1993) as a haughty seductress forced to live in a box after her limbs were amputated by love-obsessed surgeon Julian Sands in an effort to possess her (a role Kim Basinger backed out of). Both Lynch and Fenn were proud of their work in it but the film - which was overshadowed by the lawsuits against Kim Basinger after she dropped out - ultimately was a critical and commercial failure. Another outstanding performance was in NBC&apos;s miniseries Liz la diva dagli occhi viola (1995). During the shooting, Fenn fought to keep integrity in the script. Her priority was to respectfully and accurately portray Taylor, and she supported the original screenwriter&apos;s effort to concentrate on Taylor the person, not the legend. The same year she starred in an episode of I racconti della cripta (1989) directed by Robert Zemeckis, alongside Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow, as the lover of Humphrey Bogart, who appeared in the episode via CGI special effects. She went on to star in independent films that have been well received on the festival circuit like Jon Harmon Feldman&apos;s Lovelife (1997) (as a low self-esteemed waitress, along with Bruce Davison, Jon Tenney, Carla Gugino and Saffron Burrows), romantic comedy Equivoci d&apos;amore (1997) (as the dream actress of Hollywood tour bus driver Jeremy Piven, who mistakes him for a famous screenwriter) and Adrian Pasdar&apos;s neo-noir directorial debut Cement - Fino all&apos;ultimo colpo (2000), a contemporary re-telling of &quot;Othello&quot;, in which she played a tempting but imprudent femme fatale, alongside Chris Penn, Jeffrey Wright and Henry Czerny.Tired of Hollywood, Fenn contemplated starting a European career when she starred opposite Ray Winstone in the British psychological drama and huis-clos Darkness Falls (1999) (as a wealthy, neglected wife, sequestered with her husband by a man determined to understand the events that led to his wife ending up in a coma). She eventually decided to return to the United-States and gained newfound enthusiasm with the lead role in Showtime&apos;s dark comedy Rude Awakening (1998) as Billie Frank, an alcoholic ex-soap actress who struggles with her self-destructive habits. Based upon creator/executive producer Claudia Lonow&apos;s experience, the series ran from 1998 to 2001 and co-starred Lynn Redgrave, Jonathan Penner and Mario Van Peebles. Following Rude Awakening (1998), Fenn&apos;s film and television credits have included Showtime&apos;s family comedy Off Season (2001), directed by Bruce Davison (along with Hume Cronyn, Rory Culkin, Adam Arkin and Davison; as a singer who takes care of her orphaned nephew), Matthew Ryan Hoge&apos;s Il delitto Fitzgerald (2003) (as a woman who represents happiness and joie de vivre to Ryan Gosling), Showtime&apos;s Cavedweller (2004) (2004, along with Kyra Sedgwick and directed by Lisa Cholodenko), Geretta Geretta&apos;s Whitepaddy (2006) (opposite Lisa Bonet and Hill Harper, as a woman who struggles with her dysfunctional family after she reluctantly returned home and tries to fit in with her new neighborhood that has become predominantly black), Emily Skopov&apos;s Novel Romance (2006) (as a pregnancy shop owner, opposite Traci Lords and Paul Johansson), psychological thriller Presumed Dead (2006) (as a female detective working on a missing person case, who has to outwit crime novelist Duncan Regehr in order to get to the truth), and Hazzard - I Duke alla riscossa (2007) (as a flirtatious version of Lulu Hogg).Fenn has appeared along with Rob Estes and Milo Ventimiglia in a 2003 episode of Amy Sherman-Palladino&apos;s Una mamma per amica (2000), which was the pilot for a California-set spin-off, eventually dropped by the network. Sherman-Palladino brought her back in the series with a different part as Scott Patterson&apos;s ex-girlfriend and protective mother to his daughter (2006-2007). Fenn had previously had recurring parts on Dawson&apos;s Creek (1998), (2002, as Joshua Jackson&apos;s seductive boss) and Boston Public (2000) (2003-2004, as a porn star turned tutor).

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Actor Ralph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was born on December 22, 1962 in Suffolk, England, to Jennifer Anne Mary Alleyne (Lash), a novelist, and Mark Fiennes, a photographer. He is the eldest of six children. Four of his siblings are also in the arts: Martha Fiennes, a director; Magnus Fiennes, a musician; Sophie Fiennes, a producer; and Joseph Fiennes, an actor. He is of English, Irish, and Scottish origin.A noted Shakespeare interpreter, he first achieved success onstage at the Royal National Theatre. Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily BrontÃ«&apos;s Cime tempestose (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his &quot;breakout year&quot;. He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film The Baby of MÃ¢con (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg&apos;s Schindler&apos;s List (1993).

His portrayal as GÃ¶th also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute&apos;s list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994).

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (Nidelman), a radio actress, and Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an actor turned advertising executive. His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), Il virginiano (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Guerre stellari (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in I predatori dell&apos;arca perduta (1981).Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Witness - Il testimone (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Giochi di potere (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in Il fuggitivo (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.On March 5, 2015, Ford&apos;s plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.</rdfs:comment>

For four years she made commercials and finally gave her debut as an actress in the TV series Mayberry R.F.D. (1968). In 1975 Jodie was offered the role of prostitute Iris Steensma in the movie Taxi Driver (1976). This role, for which she received an Academy Award nomination in the &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; category, marked a breakthrough in her career. In 1980 she graduated as the best of her class from the College LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais and began to study English Literature at Yale University, from where she graduated magna cum laude in 1985. One tragic moment in her life was March 30th, 1981 when John Warnock Hinkley Jr. attempted to assassinate the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan. Hinkley was obsessed with Jodie and the movieTaxi Driver (1976), in which Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro, tried to shoot presidential candidate Palantine. Despite the fact that Jodie never took acting lessons, she received two Oscars before she was thirty years of age. She received her first award for her part as Sarah Tobias in Sotto accusa (1988) and the second one for her performance as Clarice Starling in Il silenzio degli innocenti (1991).</rdfs:comment>

During these years Michael developed his desire to act. At 15 he successfully auditioned for the role of a 10-year-old in a series called Leo and Me (1978). Gaining attention as a bright new star in Canadian television and movies, Michael realized his love for acting when he appeared on stage in &quot;The Shadow Box.&quot; At 18 he moved to Los Angeles and was offered a few television-series roles, but soon they stopped coming and he was surviving on boxes of macaroni and cheese. Then his agent called to tell him that he got the part of Alex P. Keaton on the situation comedy Casa Keaton (1982). He starred in the feature films Voglia di vincere (1985), Un liceo tutto matto (1983), Poison Ivy (1985) and Ritorno al futuro (1985).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer&apos;s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry&apos;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival&apos;s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets&apos; drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including &quot;Easy Reader&quot;, &quot;Mel Mounds&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot; on the Children&apos;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children&apos;s adventure, Una fattoria a New York City (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade, il duro della Criminalpol (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Uno scomodo testimone (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart - Per le strade di New York (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of A spasso con Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory - Uomini di gloria (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in Il falÃ² delle vanitÃ  (1990), Robin Hood - Principe dei ladri (1991), and La forza del singolo (1992). Freeman&apos;s next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood&apos;s de-mythologized western Gli spietati (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in Le ali della libertÃ  (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Seven (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Reazione a catena (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in Il collezionista (1997).Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute&apos;s black comedy Betty Love (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Nella morsa del ragno (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama Al vertice della tensione (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired L&apos;acchiappasogni (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Una settimana da Dio (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy Brivido biondo (2004).2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman&apos;s on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie &quot;Scrap Iron&quot; Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy&apos;s judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg&apos;s La guerra dei mondi (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale&apos;s Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Slevin - Patto criminale (2006), a second go-round as God in Un&apos;impresa da Dio (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck&apos;s directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit Non Ã¨ mai troppo tardi (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted - Scegli il tuo destino (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, Il cavaliere oscuro (2008).In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director&apos;s true-life drama Invictus - L&apos;invincibile (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics&apos; Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.Recently, Freeman appeared in RED (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan the Barbarian (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner&apos;s The Magic of Belle Isle (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with Il cavaliere oscuro - Il ritorno (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Now You See Me - I maghi del crimine (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Humanitarian and actor Richard Gere was born on August 31, 1949, in Philadelphia, the second of five children of Doris Ann (Tiffany), a homemaker, and Homer George Gere, an insurance salesman, both Mayflower descendants. Richard started early as a musician, playing a number of instruments in high school and writing music for high school productions. He graduated from North Syracuse Central High School in 1967, and won a gymnastics scholarship to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, where he majored in philosophy. He left college after two years to pursue acting, landing a lead role in the London production of the rock musical &quot;Grease&quot; in 1973. The following year he would be in other plays, such as &quot;Taming of the Shrew.&quot; Onscreen, he had a few roles, and gained recognition in In cerca di Mr. Goodbar (1977). Offscreen, he spent 1978 meeting Tibetans when he traveled to Nepal, where he spoke to many monks and lamas. Returning to the US, on Broadway he portrayed a concentration-camp prisoner in &quot;Bent,&quot; for which he received the 1980 Theatre World Award. Back in Hollywood, he played the title role in American Gigolo (1980), establishing himself as a major star; this status was reaffirmed by Ufficiale e gentiluomo (1982). In the early 1980s, Richard went to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador (amidst ongoing wars and political violence); he traveled with a doctor and visited refugee camps. It is said that Richard was romantically linked with Tuesday Weld, Priscilla Presley, Barbra Streisand and Kim Basinger. In 1990 Richard teamed up with Julia Roberts to star in the blockbuster Pretty Woman (1990); his cool reserve was the perfect complement to Julia&apos;s bubbling enthusiasm. The film captured the nation&apos;s heart, and won the People&apos;s Choice award for Best Movie. Fans clamored for years for a sequel, or at least another pairing of Julia and Richard. They got that with Se scappi, ti sposo (1999), which was a runaway success (Richard got $12 million, Julia made $17 million, the box office was $152 million, which shows what happens when you give the public what it wants!). Offscreen, Richard and Cindy Crawford got married December 12, 1991 (they were divorced in 1995). Afterwards, Richard started dating actress Carey Lowell. They had a son, Homer James Jigme Gere, on February 6, 2000. Richard was picked by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the world in 1991, and as their Sexiest Man Alive in 1999.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Since making her uncredited debut as a dancer in Beatlemania (1981), Gina Gershon has established herself as a character actress and one of the leading icons of American camp. For it was fourteen years after her movie debut that Gina made movie history as the predatory bisexual who was the leading light of a Las Vegas leg-line in director Paul Verhoeven&apos;s kitsch classic Showgirls (1995). Exploding out of a plaster-of-Paris volcano clad in nothing but body makeup and a G-string, Gina Gershon obtained cinema immortality. After Showgirls (1995), she solidified her reputation, playing a lesbian sexpot in the Wachovski Bros&apos; neo-noir Bound - Torbido inganno (1996).Gina Gershon was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills, the last in a brood of three kids. Her mother, Mickey (Koppel), worked as an interior decorator, and her father, Stanley Gershon, was a salesman and worked in the import/export business. Her paternal grandparents were from Russian Jewish families, and her maternal grandparents were born in Holland and Belgium, both of them to Jewish families from Poland. Gina was raised in the San Fernando Valley, and got the acting bug early, appearing at the age of seven in a school production of Ciao ciao Birdie (1963). Because of her acting ambitions, her parents moved to Beverly Hills so Gina could attend Beverly Hills High, where she indulged her acting jones by appearing in a student production of Capobanda (1962). Her first love, she says, is singing.After graduating from high school in 1980, she attended Emerson College in Boston, but took a part in the musical &quot;Runaways&quot;. She transferred to New York University, where her official biography says she studied philosophy and psychology, but she graduated from the Tisch School of the Arts, taking a bachelor of fine arts degree in drama in 1983. In New York City, while perfecting her craft, she co-founded the theater company Naked Angels with Helen Slater.Her big-screen breakthrough came with a part in the 1986 &quot;Brat Pack&quot; teenage hit Bella in rosa (1986). She also had parts in the Tom Cruise vehicle Cocktail (1988) and Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s Danko (1988). Of this period, she says, &quot;One of my first gigs, a movie called Cocktail (1988), I found myself at 8 in the morning, in bed, practically naked, having to make out with Tom Cruise; hmmmm... movie business - so far, so good&quot;.Citing Frank Sinatra&apos;s song &quot;My Way&quot; as an inspiration, she says that following Cocktail (1988), &quot;I was fortunate enough to play many diversified roles in film, television and stage. Not always to the liking of my managers and agents, but I always did what I wanted....&quot; She played Nancy Barbato Sinatra, Frank&apos;s first wife, in the TV miniseries Sinatra (1992).Gina Gershon became a celebrity in Showgirls (1995). The following year, Gershon solidified her claim on second-tier stardom playing the calculating lesbian &quot;Corky&quot; in the crime movie Bound (1995). She never did capitalize on her mid-1990s breakthrough, but Gershon is established as a character actress and is never out of work, unlike most of her female peers who started out in the industry at the same time. Though no classic beauty, the talented thespian remains gainfully employed while many actresses of her vintage are out of work as she is possessed of a unique look and smoldering sex appeal that comes across on camera.Gershon is versatile, too, as at home on stage as she is in front of the camera. After appearing in off-Broadway and regional theater productions, she made her Broadway debut as a replacement in Sam Mendes&apos; revival of Cabaret (1972) in January 2001. For six months, she played the key role of &quot;Sally Bowles&quot;, returning that October to reprise the role for another month. In 2008, she once again appeared on Broadway in the revival of the farce &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; on Broadway, which won the Tony award for Best Revival.Gina Gershon also is a children&apos;s book writer. In 2008, Putmam Juvenile published her &quot;Camp Creepy Time&quot;, a tale of a boy who discovers aliens at his summer camp, which she co-wrote with her brother, Dann Gershon. &quot;Camp Creepy Time&quot; recently was optioned by DreamWorks, which plans to turn it into a movie. In 2008, she also released &quot;In Search Of Cleo&quot;, a CD featuring nine songs which she wrote or co-wrote.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Whoopi Goldberg was born Caryn Elaine Johnson in the Chelsea section of Manhattan on November 13, 1955. Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi&apos;s recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. Goldberg came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as Moms Mabley. She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were Ted Danson and Frank Langella. Goldberg was married three times and was once addicted to drugs.Goldberg had her first big film starring role in Il colore viola (1985). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like Affittasi ladra (1987), The Telephone (1988) and Jumpin&apos; Jack Flash (1986). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash Ghost - Fantasma (1990). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). She admitted to being a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.Goldberg received another smash hit role in Sister Act: Una svitata in abito da suora (1992). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including Made in America (1993) and Bolle di sapone (1991). Goldberg followed up to her success with Sister Act 2 - PiÃ¹ svitata che mai (1993), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first.As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as Eddie - Un&apos;Allenatrice Fuori Di Testa (1996) and Funny Money - Come fare i soldi senza lavorare (1996), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as In fondo al cuore (1999) and Benvenuta in paradiso (1998). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include Rat Race (2001) and the quietly received Venga il tuo regno (2001). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including Pagemaster - L&apos;avventura meravigliosa (1994) and Capitan Planet e i Planeteers (1990), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including T-Rex - Il mio amico Dino (1995)).Whoopi is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Whoopi is also the center square in Hollywood Squares (1998), sometimes hosts the Academy Awards, and is an author, with the book &quot;Book.&quot;</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum was born October 22, 1952 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of four children of Shirley (Temeles), a radio broadcaster who also ran an appliances firm, and Harold L. Goldblum, a doctor. His father was of Russian Jewish descent and his mother was of Austrian Jewish ancestry.Goldblum began his career on the New York stage after moving to the city at age seventeen. Possessing his own unique style of delivery, Goldblum made an impression on moviegoers with little more than a single line in Woody Allen&apos;s Io e Annie (1977), when he fretted about having forgotten his mantra. Goldblum went on to appear in the remake Terrore dallo spazio profondo (1978) and co-starred with Ben Vereen in the detective series Premiata agenzia Whitney (1980) before a high-profile turn in the classic ensemble film Il grande freddo (1983).The quirky actor turned up in the suitably quirky film Le avventure di Buckaroo Banzai nella quarta dimensione (1984), which became a 1980s cult classic, starred in the modern-day film noir Tutto in una notte (1985), then went on to a breakthrough role in the David Cronenberg remake La mosca (1986), which also featured actress Geena Davis, Goldblum&apos;s wife from 1987-1990 and co-star in two additional films: Una notte in Transilvania (1985) and Julien Temple&apos;s Le ragazze della Terra sono facili (1988).Goldblum was the rather unlikely star of some of the biggest blockbusters of the 1990s: Steven Spielberg&apos;s dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park (1993) and its sequel Il mondo perduto - Jurassic Park (1997), as well as the alien invasion film Independence Day (1996). These films saw Goldblum playing the type of intellectual characters he has become associated with. More recently, roles have included critically acclaimed turns in Igby Goes Down (2002) and Wes Anderson&apos;s Le avventure acquatiche di Steve Zissou (2004). In 2009, he returned to television to star in his second crime series Criminal Intent (2001).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother&apos;s family, originally surnamed &quot;Fraga&quot;, was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a &quot;fractured&quot; family. He moved around a great deal after his parents&apos; divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on Splash - Una sirena a Manhattan (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character&apos;s wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy La retata (1987), Hanks&apos; stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Ragazze vincenti (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his &quot;modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top&quot;. This &quot;modern era&quot; began for Hanks, first with Insonnia d&apos;amore (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance &quot;charming&quot;, and most critics agreed that Hanks&apos; portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, &quot;Above all, credit for Philadelphia&apos;s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.&quot; Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: &quot;When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.&quot; Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks&apos; next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar&apos;s computer-animated film Toy Story - Il mondo dei giocattoli (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy Music Graffiti (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Teri Hatcher is an American actress, writer, presenter, and former NFL cheerleader. She is known for her television roles, portraying Lois Lane on the ABC series Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993-1997), and as Susan Mayer on the television series Desperate Housewives (2004-2012), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.Teri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, the only child of Esther (Beshur), a computer programmer, and Owen Walker Hatcher, Jr., a nuclear physicist and electrical engineer. She has Syrian (from her immigrant maternal grandfather), Irish, English, and Czech ancestry. Teri grew up in Sunnyvale, California, and spent her childhood dancing, and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted &quot;Most Likely to Become a Solid Gold (1980) Dancer&quot; by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series Love Boat (1977). She went on to play &quot;Penny Parker,&quot; a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on MacGyver (1985). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy &quot;Lois Lane&quot; on Lois &amp; Clark - Le nuove avventure di Superman (1993), saying that she didn&apos;t want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as &quot;Penny Parker.&quot;She married actor Jon Tenney in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter Emerson Tenney on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play &quot;Sally Bowles&quot; in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera Desperate Housewives - I segreti di Wisteria Lane (2004), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, &quot;Susan Mayer,&quot; was consistently named as America&apos;s favorite &quot;Desperate Housewife.&quot; Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show&apos;s first season was even over.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ethan Green Hawke was born on November 6, 1970 in Austin, Texas, to Leslie Carole (Green), a charity worker, and James Steven Hawke, an insurance actuary. His parents were students at the University of Texas at the time but divorced when Ethan was 5 years old. His mother raised him alone for the next five years, moving around the country, until she remarried in 1981 and the family settled in Princeton Junction, New Jersey.He attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers (1985). He got the role (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for several years.He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in L&apos;attimo fuggente (1989) and he did not complete his degree. He then appeared in numerous films before taking a role in the Generation X drama Giovani, carini e disoccupati (1994) for which he received critical praise. He starred in the romantic drama Prima dell&apos;alba (1995), and its later sequels Prima del tramonto (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony Award nomination for his role in &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of serious and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca - La porta dell&apos;universo (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001). His role as the father in the coming-of-age drama Boyhood (2014) earned him multiple award nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor.Meanwhile, he also wrote two novels: &quot;The Hottest State&quot; (1996) and &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; (2002).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1966-09-02</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of Hollywood&apos;s most dazzling leading actresses, Salma Hayek was born on September 2, 1966, in the oil boomtown of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Hayek has freely admitted that she and her brother, Sami, were spoiled rotten by her well-to-do businessman father, Sami Hayek Dominguez, and her opera-singing mother, Diana JimÃ©nez Medina. Her father is of Lebanese descent and her mother is of Mexican/Spanish ancestry. After having seen Willy Wonka e la fabbrica di cioccolato (1971) in a local movie theatre, Salma decided she wanted to become an actress. At 12, she was sent to the Academy of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she pulled pranks on the nuns by setting their clocks back three hours. She was soon expelled. Only after attending Mexico City&apos;s Universidad Iberoamericana did she feel ready to pursue acting seriously.She soon landed the title role in Teresa (1989), a hugely successful soap opera which earned her the star status in her native Mexico. However, anxious to make films and to explore her talent and passion, Hayek left both Teresa (1989) and Mexico in 1991. Heartbroken fans spread rumors that she was having a secret affair with Mexico&apos;s president and left to escape his wife&apos;s wrath.At long last, Salma made her way to Los Angeles. The 24 year old actress approached Hollywood with naÃ¯ve enthusiasm, and quickly learned that Latin actresses were, if at all, typecast as the mistress maid or local prostitute. By late 1992, Hayek had landed only bit parts. She appeared on Street Justice (1991), The Sinbad Show (1993), Corsie in allegria (1991), and as a sexy maid on the HBO series Dream On (1990). She also had one line in the Allison Anders film Mi vida loca (1993). Feeling under-appreciated by Anglo filmmakers, Hayek vented her frustrations on comedian Paul Rodriguez&apos;s late-night Spanish-language talk show in 1992.Robert Rodriguez and his producer wife Elizabeth Avellan happened to be watching and were immediately smitten with the intelligent, opinionated young woman. He soon gave her her big break--to star opposite Antonio Banderas in the now cult classic Desperado (1995), which put her on Hollywood&apos;s map. The moviegoers proved to be as dazzled with Hayek as he had been. After her break, she was cast again by Rodriguez to star in his Dal tramonto all&apos;alba (1996). Although her vampy role opposite George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino was a small one, it was a good credit to her box office name. Hayek&apos;s first star billing came later that year with Mela e tequila (1997) opposite Friends (1994) actor Matthew Perry. The film was a modest hit, and Hayek continued to rise her star in both commercial and artistic films such as: Breaking up - Lasciarsi (1997) with an unknown Russell Crowe; Studio 54 (1998) about the rise and fall of the legendary New York club; Dogma (1999), playing the muse in a somewhat odd comedy co-starring Matt Damon and Chris Rock; In the Time of the Butterflies (2001), the small artistic film which won Hayek an ALMA award as best actress; and the 1999 summer blockbuster Wild Wild West (1999). Her production company &quot;Ventanarosa&quot; produced the 1999 Mexican feature film Nessuno scrive al colonnello (1999), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and selected as Mexico&apos;s official Oscar entry for best foreign film.The new millennium started out quietly around Salma as she was preparing to produce and star in her dream role, that of Frida Kahlo, the legendary Mexican painter whom Salma had been admiring her entire life and whose story she wanted to bring to the big screen ever since her arrival in Hollywood. It finally happened in 2002. Frida (2002), co-produced by Hayek, was a beautifully made film overflowing with passion and enthusiasm, with terrific performances from Salma and Alfred Molina as Kahlo&apos;s cheating husband &quot;Diego Rivera&quot;. On the side was an entourage of stars including Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush, Edward Norton and Valeria Golino.The picture was a hit and was nominated for six Oscars, including best actress for Hayek, and won the awards for make-up and its brilliant original score by Elliot Goldenthal. Hayek established herself as the serious actress that she is and, in the same year, expanded her horizons, directing The Maldonado Miracle (2003), which was shown at the Sundance Film festival. In 2003, she starred in the final of Rodriguez&apos;s &quot;Desperado&quot; trilogy C&apos;era una volta in Messico (2003), again opposite Banderas, and has just finished After the Sunset (2004) opposite Pierce Brosnan and Chiedi alla polvere (2006) opposite Colin Farrell. Both are scheduled for release in early 2005. In the works are Robert Altman&apos;s &quot;Paint&quot; and Bandidas (2006) in which she will star with her friend PenÃ©lope Cruz.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Anthony Hopkins was born on December 31, 1937, in Margam, Wales, to Muriel Anne (Yeats) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. His parents were both of half Welsh and half English descent. Influenced by Richard Burton, he decided to study at College of Music and Drama and graduated in 1957. In 1965, he moved to London and joined the National Theatre, invited by Laurence Olivier, who could see the talent in Hopkins. In 1967, he made his first film for television, A Flea in Her Ear (1967).From this moment on, he enjoyed a successful career in cinema and television. In 1968, he worked on Il leone d&apos;inverno (1968) with Timothy Dalton. Many successes came later, and Hopkins&apos; remarkable acting style reached the four corners of the world. In 1977, he appeared in two major films: Quell&apos;ultimo ponte (1977) with James Caan, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Elliott Gould and Laurence Olivier, and Maximilian Schell.

In 1987 he was awarded with the Commander of the order of the British Empire. This year was also important in his cinematic life, with 84 Charing Cross Road (1987), acclaimed by specialists. In 1993, he was knighted.In the 1990s, Hopkins acted in movies like Ore disperate (1990) and Casa Howard (1992), Quel che resta del giorno (1993) (nominee for the Oscar), Vento di passioni (1994), Gli intrighi del potere - Nixon (1995) (nominee for the Oscar), Surviving Picasso (1996), Amistad (1997) (nominee for the Oscar), La maschera di Zorro (1998), Vi presento Joe Black (1998) and Instinct - Istinto primordiale (1999).

Wanting to be a dancer, Hurley went to ballet boarding school at 12, but soon returned home. When it came time to go to college, Hurley won a scholarship to the London Studio Centre which taught courses for dance and theater. Soon, Hurley wore the punk rock look with pink hair and a nose ring, but to get work, she had to change her image to one that was castable. After college, Hurley worked in the theater and made her screen debut in Aria (1987). Roles in Television and a film, Remando al viento (1988), which included a young actor named Hugh Grant, soon followed. European films followed her appearance in the BBC serial Christabel (1988). Her film debut in a Hollywood movie was in the Wesley Snipes action drama Passenger 57 - Terrore ad alta quota (1992). When Hugh Grant was picked up with Divine Brown, Hurley became headline news. Added to this was the fact that she was the model representing top cosmetics house EstÃ©e Lauder, and there was nowhere Hurley could go to get away from the press. In 1994, Hurley and Hugh Grant set up Simian Films in partnership with Castle Rock Entertainment. As Head of Development, Hurley found the script and produced her first film Extreme Measures - Soluzioni estreme (1996), which stars Hugh Grant.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tommy Lee Jones was born in San Saba, Texas, the son of Lucille Marie (Scott), a police officer and beauty shop owner, and Clyde C. Jones, who worked on oil fields. Tommy himself worked in underwater construction and on an oil rig. He attended St. Mark&apos;s School of Texas, a prestigious prep school for boys in Dallas, on a scholarship, and went to Harvard on another scholarship. He roomed with future Vice President Al Gore and played offensive guard in the famous 29-29 Harvard-Yale football game of &apos;68 known as &quot;The Tie.&quot; He received a B.A. in English literature and graduated cum laude from Harvard in 1969.Following college, he moved to New York and began his theatrical career on Broadway in &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot; (1969). In 1970, he made his film debut in Love Story (1970). While living in New York, he continued to appear in various plays, both on- and off-Broadway: &quot;Fortune and Men&apos;s Eyes&quot; (1969); &quot;Four on a Garden&quot; (1971); &quot;Blue Boys&quot; (1972); &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot; (1974). During this time, he also appeared on a daytime soap opera, Una vita da vivere (1968) as Dr. Mark Toland from 1971-75. He moved with wife Kate Lardner, granddaughter of short-story writer/columnist Ring Lardner, and her two children from a previous marriage, to Los Angeles.There he began to get some roles on television: Charlie&apos;s Angels (1976) (pilot episode); Fine di un giorno di festa (1976); and The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977). While working on the movie Back Roads (1981), he met and fell in love with Kimberlea Cloughley, whom he later married. More roles in television--both on network and cable--stage and film garnered him a reputation as a strong, explosive, thoughtful actor who could handle supporting as well as leading roles. He made his directorial debut in The Good Old Boys (1995) on TNT. In addition to directing and starring in the film, he co-wrote the teleplay (with J.T. Allen). The film, based on Elmer Kelton&apos;s novel, is set in west Texas where Jones has strong family ties. Consequently, this story of a cowboy facing the end of an era has special meaning for him.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Milla Jovovich is an Ukrainian-born actress, supermodel, fashion designer, singer and public figure, who was on the cover of more than a hundred magazines, and starred in such films as Il quinto elemento (1997), Ultraviolet (2006), and the Resident Evil (2002) franchise.Milica Bogdanovna Jovovich was born on December 17, 1975 in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union (now in Ukraine). Her Serbian father, Bogdan Jovovich, was a medical doctor in Kiev. There, he met her mother, Galina Jovovich (nÃ©e Loginova), a Russian actress. At the age of 5, in 1981, Milla emigrated with her parents from the Soviet Union, moving first to London, UK, then to Sacramento, California, and eventually settled in Los Angeles. There her parents worked as house cleaners for the household of director Brian De Palma. Her parents separated, and eventually divorced, because her father was arrested and spent several years in prison.Young Milla Jovovich was brought up by her single mother in Los Angeles. In addition to her native Russian, she also speaks Serbian and English. However, in spite of her cosmopolitan background, Milla was ostracized by some of her classmates, as a kid who emigrated from the Soviet Union amidst the paranoia of the Cold War. Many emotional scars had affected her behavior, but she eventually emerged as a resilient, multi-talented, albeit rebellious and risk-taking girl. She was coached by her actress mother since her childhood, first at home, then studied music, ballet, and acting in Los Angeles.She shot to international fame after she was spotted by the photographer Richard Avedon at the age of 11, and was featured in Revlon&apos;s &quot;Most Unforgettable Women in the World&quot; advertisements, and on the cover of the Italian fashion magazine &apos;Lei&apos; which was her first cover shoot. She made her first professional model contract at the age of 12, and soon made it to the cover of &apos;The Face&apos;, &apos;Vogue&apos;, &apos;Cosmopolitan&apos; and many other magazines. In 1994, she appeared on the cover of &apos;High Times&apos; in the UK, at the age of 18. The total number of her magazine covers worldwide was over one hundred by 2004, and keeps counting. In 2004, she made $10.4 million, becoming the highest paid supermodel in the world.Milla appeared in ad campaigns for Chanel, Versace, Emporio Armani, Donna Karen, DKNY, Celine, P&amp;K, H&amp;H, and continues her role as the worldwide spokesperson and model for L&apos;Oreal. Thanks to their continued success with Milla, Giorgio Armani chose her to be the face of his fragrance, Night. In addition to Armani&apos;s fragrance, Milla was the face for Calvin Klein&apos;s Obsession and Christian Dior&apos;s Poison for over 10 years and has most recently become the new face for Donna Karan&apos;s Cashmere Mist fragrance, which debuts in August 2009. Milla continues to shoot with the fashion industry&apos;s most sought after photographers, including Peter Lindbergh, Mario Sorrenti, Craig McDean and Inez &amp; Vinoodh.Milla made her acting debut in the Disney Channel movie La leggenda della cittÃ  incantata (1988) and she made guest appearances on television series including Sposati con figli (1987) (in 1989 as a French exchange student), Paradise (1988) and Parker Lewis (1990). In 1988, at age 12, she made her film debut credited as Milla in a supporting role in Congiunzione di due lune (1988) by writer/director Zalman King. During the 1980s and early 1990s, she played several supporting roles as a teenage actress in film and on television, then starred in Ritorno alla laguna blu (1991). In 1997, she co-starred opposite Bruce Willis in the sci-fi blockbuster Il quinto elemento (1997), then she starred as the title character of Giovanna d&apos;Arco (1999).In the early 2000s, Milla had a few years of uncertainty in her acting career due to the uneven quality of her films, as well as some hectic events in her private life. She appeared with Mel Gibson in Wim Wenders&apos; The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival. She went on to co-star with Wes Bentley and Sarah Polley in Le bianche tracce della vita (2000) and in Ben Stiller&apos;s spoof of the world of models and high-fashion, Zoolander (2001).Milla achieved box office success in the U.S. and around the world with the action-packed thriller, Resident Evil (2002), based on the wildly popular video game, Resident Evil. It was written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla reprised her role as the zombie slaying heroine, Alice, in Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), Resident Evil: Extinction (2007), Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010), Resident Evil: Retribution (2012), and again in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) A seventh resident Evil movie is in pre-production.She received glowing reviews opposite Oscar-winner Adrien Brody and Illeana Douglas in Dummy (2002) which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. In the spring of 2006, Milla returned to the big screen as action heroine, Violet, in the futuristic film Ultraviolet (2006) directed by Kurt Wimmer.Focusing on her personal sense of style, her love of fashion led Milla and her friend and business partner, Carmen Hawk, to launch their Jovovich-Hawk clothing line, which achieved instant acclaim in the domestic and international fashion world. The fresh, unique line garnered the attention of red carpet watchers and fashion magazines, including American Vogue, who featured Jovovich-Hawk on their coveted list of &quot;10 Things to Watch Out for in 2005.&quot; A student of voice and guitar since she was very young, Milla began writing songs for her first record at the age of 15.Her first album, &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, was released by EMI Records in 1994. Informed by her experiences as a child growing up as a Russian emigrant in the Red-bashing Reagan era, the introspective European-folkish debut drew favorable reviews for Milla&apos;s songwriting and performing. She continues to write music, and has had songs featured on several film soundtracks. She has been writing music and lyrics to her song-demos, playing her guitar and sampling other sounds from her computer, and allowing free download and remix of her songs from her website.Charitable work also plays a major part in Milla&apos;s life. She has served as Master of Ceremonies and co-chaired with Elizabeth Taylor for the amfAR and Cinema Against AIDS event at the Venice Film Festival, and has been heavily involved with The Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, as well as The Wildlands Project.For many years Milla Jovovich has been maintaining a healthier lifestyle, practicing yoga and meditation, trying to avoid junk food, and cooking for herself. Since she was a little girl, Milla has been writing a private diary, a habit she learned from her mother. She has been keeping a record of many good and bad facts of her life, her travels, her relationships, and all important ideas and events in her career, planning eventually to publish an autobiography. After dissolution of her two previous marriages, Milla Jovovich became engaged to film director Paul W.S. Anderson; their daughter, Ever Anderson, was born on November 3, 2007. They got married on August 22, 2009. Their second daughter, Dashiel Edan, was born on April 1, 2015.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">American actor and producer Harvey Keitel was born on May 13, 1939 in Brooklyn, New York City, to Miriam (Klein) and Harry Keitel. An Oscar and Golden Globe Award nominee, he has appeared in films such as Martin Scorsese&apos;s Mean Streets - Domenica in chiesa, lunedÃ¬ all&apos;inferno (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), Ridley Scott&apos;s I duellanti (1977) and Thelma &amp; Louise (1991), Peter Yates&apos; Codice 3: emergenza assoluta (1976), Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Le iene (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), Jane Campion&apos;s Lezioni di piano (1993), Abel Ferrara&apos;s Il cattivo tenente (1992), Robert Rodriguez&apos;s Dal tramonto all&apos;alba (1996), James Mangold&apos;s Cop Land (1997), Paolo Sorrentino&apos;s Youth - La giovinezza (2015). He is regarded as one of the greatest method actors ever. Along with actors Al Pacino and Ellen Burstyn, he is the current co-president of the Actors Studio.Keitel studied under both Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg and at the HB Studio, eventually landing roles in some Off-Broadway productions. During this time, Keitel auditioned for filmmaker Martin Scorsese and gained a starring role as &quot;J.R.&quot;, in Scorsese&apos;s first feature film, Chi sta bussando alla mia porta? (1967). Since then, Scorsese and Keitel have worked together on several projects. Keitel had the starring role in Scorsese&apos;s Mean Streets - Domenica in chiesa, lunedÃ¬ all&apos;inferno (1973), which also proved to be Robert De Niro&apos;s breakthrough film. Keitel re-teamed with Scorsese for Alice non abita piÃ¹ qui (1974), in which he had a villainous supporting role, and appeared with Robert De Niro again in Scorsese&apos;s Taxi Driver (1976), playing the role of Jodie Foster&apos;s pimp.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Elegant Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood&apos;s top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were there on educational visas.Kidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor, and Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole&apos;s father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents&apos; native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole&apos;s first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in La banda della Bmx (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Ore 10: calma piatta (1989).Kidman&apos;s next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise&apos;s doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Giorni di tuono (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman&apos;s moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate - A scuola di gangster (1991). She reunited with Cruise for Cuori ribelli (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger My Life - Questa mia vita (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant&apos;s Da morire (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics&apos; awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James&apos;s Ritratto di signora (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in The Peacemaker (1997), adding &quot;action star&quot; to her professional repertoire.She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick&apos;s sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple&apos;s on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise&apos;s homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents&apos; campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Val Kilmer was born in Los Angeles, California, to Gladys Swanette (Ekstadt) and Eugene Dorris Kilmer, who was a real estate developer and aerospace equipment distributor. His mother, born in Indiana, was from a Swedish family, and his father was from Texas. Val studied at Hollywood&apos;s Professional&apos;s School and, in his teens, entered Juilliard&apos;s drama program. His professional acting career began on stage, and he still participates in theater; he played Hamlet at the 1988 Colorado Shakespeare Festival. His film debut was in the 1984 spoof Top Secret! (1984), wherein he starred as blond rock idol Nick Rivers. He was in a number of films throughout the 1980s, including the 1986 smash Top Gun (1986). Despite his obvious talent and range, it wasn&apos;t until his astonishingly believable performance as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone&apos;s The Doors (1991) that the world sat up and took notice. Kilmer again put his good baritone to use in the movie, performing all of the concert pieces. Since then, he has played two more American legends, Elvis Presley in Una vita al massimo (1993) and Doc Holliday in Tombstone (1993). In July 1994, it was announced that Kilmer would be taking over the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne from Michael Keaton.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, at the Maine General Hospital in Portland. His parents were Nellie Ruth (Pillsbury), who worked as a caregiver at a mental institute, and Donald Edwin King, a merchant seaman. His father was born under the surname &quot;Pollock,&quot; but used the last name &quot;King,&quot; under which Stephen was born. He has an older brother, David. The Kings were a typical family until one night, when Donald said he was stepping out for cigarettes and was never heard from again. Ruth took over raising the family with help from relatives. They traveled throughout many states over several years, finally moving back to Durham, Maine, in 1958.Stephen began his actual writing career in January of 1959, when David and Stephen decided to publish their own local newspaper named &quot;Dave&apos;s Rag&quot;. David bought a mimeograph machine, and they put together a paper they sold for five cents an issue. Stephen attended Lisbon High School, in Lisbon, in 1962. Collaborating with his best friend Chris Chesley in 1963, they published a collection of 18 short stories called &quot;People, Places, and Things--Volume I&quot;. King&apos;s stories included &quot;Hotel at the End of the Road&quot;, &quot;I&apos;ve Got to Get Away!&quot;, &quot;The Dimension Warp&quot;, &quot;The Thing at the Bottom of the Well&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m Falling&quot;, &quot;The Cursed Expedition&quot;, and &quot;The Other Side of the Fog.&quot; A year later, King&apos;s amateur press, Triad and Gaslight Books, published a two-part book titled &quot;The Star Invaders&quot;.King made his first actual published appearance in 1965 in the magazine Comics Review with his story &quot;I Was a Teenage Grave Robber.&quot; The story ran about 6,000 words in length. In 1966 he graduated from high school and took a scholarship to attend the University of Maine. Looking back on his high school days, King recalled that &quot;my high school career was totally undistinguished. I was not at the top of my class, nor at the bottom.&quot; Later that summer King began working on a novel called &quot;Getting It On&quot;, about some kids who take over a classroom and try unsuccessfully to ward off the National Guard. During his first year at college, King completed his first full-length novel, &quot;The Long Walk.&quot; He submitted the novel to Bennett Cerf/Random House only to have it rejected. King took the rejection badly and filed the book away.He made his first small sale--$35--with the story &quot;The Glass Floor&quot;. In June 1970 King graduated from the University of Maine with a Bachelor of Science degree in English and a certificate to teach high school. King&apos;s next idea came from the poem by Robert Browning, &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.&quot; He found bright colored green paper in the library and began work on &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; saga, but his chronic shortage of money meant that he was unable to further pursue the novel, and it, too, was filed away. King took a job at a filling station pumping gas for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour. Soon he began to earn money for his writings by submitting his short stories to men&apos;s magazines such as Cavalier.On January 2, 1971, he married Tabitha King (born Tabitha Jane Spruce). In the fall of 1971 King took a teaching job at Hampden Academy, earning $6,400 a year. The Kings then moved to Hermon, a town west of Bangor. Stephen then began work on a short story about a teenage girl named Carietta White. After completing a few pages, he decided it was not a worthy story and crumpled the pages up and tossed them into the trash. Fortunately, Tabitha took the pages out and read them. She encouraged her husband to continue the story, which he did. In January 1973 he submitted &quot;Carrie&quot; to Doubleday. In March Doubleday bought the book. On May 12 the publisher sold the paperback rights for the novel to New American Library for $400,000. His contract called for his getting half of that sum, and he quit his teaching job to pursue writing full time. The rest, as they say, is history.Since then King has had numerous short stories and novels published and movies made from his work. He has been called the &quot;Master of Horror&quot;. His books have been translated into 33 different languages, published in over 35 different countries. There are over 300 million copies of his novels in publication. He continues to live in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, and writes out of his home.In June 1999 King was severely injured in an accident, he was walking alongside a highway and was hit by a car, that left him in critical condition with injuries to his lung, broken ribs, a broken leg and a severely fractured hip. After three weeks of operations, he was released from the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Nastassja Kinski was born Nastassja Aglaia Nakszynski on January 24, 1961 in Berlin, Germany, the daughter of German actor Klaus Kinski. In 1976, she met director Roman Polanski, who urged her to study method acting with Lee Strasberg in the United States. Kinski starred in the Italian romantic drama CosÃ¬ come sei (1978) with Marcello Mastroianni, gaining her recognition in the United States after the film&apos;s release on December 21, 1979. She played the title character in Polanski&apos;s romantic drama Tess (1979), an adaptation of Thomas Hardy&apos;s novel &quot;Tess of the d&apos;Urbervilles&quot; (1891).Kinski starred in Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s romantic musical Un sogno lungo un giorno (1981), her first film made in the United States. The film became a box office bomb and was a major loss for Coppola&apos;s production company Zoetrope Studios. She also starred in the erotic horror movie Il bacio della pantera (1982) with Malcolm McDowell, a remake of the 1942 classic of the same name. She appeared in Wim Wenders&apos; drama movie Paris, Texas (1984) with Harry Dean Stanton and Dean Stockwell. One of her most acclaimed films, the film won the Palme d&apos;Or (Golden Palm) at the Cannes Film Festival.During the 1990s, Kinski appeared in a number of American films, including the action movie Terminal Velocity (1994) opposite Charlie Sheen, Complice la notte (1997), Amici &amp; vicini (1998), John Landis&apos; Delitto imperfetto (1998), and Il figlio perduto (1999). She has appeared in more than 60 films in Europe and the United States.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kevin Kline was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Margaret and Robert Joseph Kline, who owned several stores. His father was of German Jewish descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. After attending Indiana University in Bloomington, Kline studied at the Juilliard School in New York. In 1972, Kline joined the Acting Company in New York which was run by John Houseman. With this company, Kline performed Shakespeare across the country. On the stage, Kline has won two Tony Awards for his work in the musicals &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1981). After working on the Television soap Aspettando il domani (1951), Kline went to Hollywood where his first film was La scelta di Sophie (1982). He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. His work in the ensemble cast of Il grande freddo (1983) would again be highly successful, so that when Lawrence Kasdan wrote Silverado (1985), Kline would again be part of the cast. With his role as Otto &quot;Don&apos;t call me Stupid!&quot; West in the film Un pesce di nome Wanda (1988), Kline would win the Oscar for Supporting Actor. Kline could play classic roles such as Hamlet in Great Performances: Hamlet (1990); or a swashbuckling actor like Douglas Fairbanks in Charlot - Chaplin (1992); or a comedic role in Bolle di sapone (1991). In all the films that he has worked in, it is hard to find a performance that is not well done. In 1989, Kline married actress Phoebe Cates.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Diane Lane was born on January 22, 1965, in New York. She is the daughter of acting coach Burton Eugene &quot;Burt&quot; Lane and nightclub singer/centerfold Colleen Farrington. Her parents&apos; families were both from the state of Georgia. Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six. Her work in such acclaimed theater productions as &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot; led to her being called to Hollywood. She was 13 when she was cast by director George Roy Hill in his wonderful 1979 film Una piccola storia d&apos;amore (1979), opposite Sir Laurence Olivier. The film only did so-so commercially, but Olivier praised his young co-star, calling her the new Grace Kelly. After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including &quot;Time&quot;, which declared her the &quot;new young acting sensation&quot;. However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as Touched by Love (1980), Branco selvaggio (1981), Movie Madness (1982), Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and, most unmemorably, Six Pack (1982), all of which failed to set her career on fire.She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola took note of Diane&apos;s appeal and cast her in two &quot;youth&quot;-oriented films based on S.E. Hinton novels. Indeed, Rusty il selvaggio (1983) and I ragazzi della 56Âª strada (1983) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, Splash - Una sirena a Manhattan (1984) (which was a surprise hit for Daryl Hannah). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: Walter Hill&apos;s glossy rock &apos;n&apos; roll fable Strade di fuoco (1984) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic Cotton Club (1984) co-starring Richard Gere was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn&apos;t. Possibly &quot;burned out&quot; by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she &quot;retired&quot; from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her &quot;retirement&quot; have since grown in popularity, and &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn&apos;t get when it was first released.The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller All&apos;improvviso uno sconosciuto (1987), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen Braccio vincente (1987) with Matt Dillon and Tommy Lee Jones. In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn&apos;t until 1989&apos;s smash hit TV mini-series Colomba solitaria (1989) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable &quot;whore with a heart&quot; won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again. Another well-received TV production, Discesa pericolosa (1990), was followed by smaller roles in major films like Richard Attenborough&apos;s Charlot - Chaplin (1992) and Mike Binder&apos;s Ritorno a Tamakwa (1993), and larger parts in small independent films like Un uomo, una donna, una pistola (1992), Vital signs: un anno, una vita (1990) and Scacco mortale (1992). Indeed, the latter two films co-starred her then-husband, Christopher Lambert, with whom she had a daughter named Eleanor.Diane was now re-established in Hollywood and started to appear in higher-profile co-starring roles in some big-budget, major movies like Walter Hill&apos;s Wild Bill (1995), the Sylvester Stallone actioner Dredd - La legge sono io (1995), the Robin Williams&apos;s comedy Jack (1996) and Delitto alla Casa Bianca (1997) co-starring Wesley Snipes. However, all of these still did not quite make Diane a &quot;big-name star&quot; and, by 1997, she found herself, possibly by choice, back in smaller, personal projects.Her next role as a frustrated 1960s housewife in the independent hit A Walk on the Moon - Complice la luna (1999) deservedly won her rave notices and, at last, gave her career the big lift it needed. The cute but tear-jerking comedy Il mio cane Skip (2000) also proved to be a small-scale success. However, it was the Â£330-million worldwide grossing blockbuster hit La tempesta perfetta (2000) that finally made Diane Lane the household name that she always should have been.After the worldwide success of &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, she was more in demand than ever. She played Leelee Sobieski&apos;s sinister junkie guardian in the slick thriller Prigione di vetro (2001), and co-starred with Keanu Reeves in the #1 smash hit Hardball (2001). However, her greatest career moment was still to come with her lead role in the enormous critical and commercial hit Unfaithful - L&apos;amore infedele (2002), in which she superbly portrayed Richard Gere&apos;s adulterous wife. Her performance won the respect of critics and audiences alike, as well as many awards and nominations including Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.Her follow-up films including Sotto il sole della Toscana (2003), Partnerperfetto.com (2005), Hollywoodland (2006), Un anno da ricordare (2010), and the blockbuster, L&apos;uomo d&apos;acciaio (2013), were all received and her performances were highly praised. She won further Best Actress Golden Globe nominations for her roles in Sotto il sole della Toscana (2003) and Cinema Verite (2011).She is very well regarded within the industry, adored by film fans, and has a credibility and quality that is all too rare today. Her immense talent at playing human and real characters, her &quot;drop dead gorgeous&quot; beauty and down-to-earth grittiness guarantees that she will stay on top, and she guarantee has already shown the kind of resilience that will keep her working for a long, long time.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jude Law is an English actor. Law has been nominated for two Academy Awards and continues to build a prolific body of work that spans from early successes such as Gattaca - La porta dell&apos;universo (1997) and Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999) to more recent turns as Dr. John Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes - Gioco di ombre (2011), as Hugo&apos;s father in Hugo Cabret (2011) and in the titular role in Dom Hemingway (2013).David Jude Law was born on December 29, 1972 in Lewisham, London, England, to Margaret Anne (Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law, both of whom taught at comprehensive schools; his father later became a headmaster. Law has said that he was named after both the book Jude the Obscure and the song Hey Jude.In 1992, Jude began his stage career. He starred in many plays throughout London, and was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award of &quot;Outstanding Newcomer&quot; After doing the play &quot;Indiscretions&quot; in London, he moved and did it again on Broadway. This time, he was alongside Kathleen Turner. He then received a Tony Nomination for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor&quot;. He was then rewarded the Theatre World Award. After Broadway, Jude started on the big screen, in many independent films. His first big-named movie was Gattaca - La porta dell&apos;universo (1997), with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. He also had a good role in Mezzanotte nel giardino del bene e del male (1997). Jude&apos;s latest rise to fame has been because of Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999), in which he plays Matt Damon&apos;s obsession. The film did very well at the box office, and critics loved Jude&apos;s acting.Following the success of Gattaca - La porta dell&apos;universo (1997) and Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999), Law&apos;s feature film career continued to gain momentum throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s with roles in such films as Il nemico alle porte (2001), Era mio padre (2002), I Heart Huckabees - Le strane coincidenze della vita (2004), The Aviator (2004) and many others. Law is one of three actors, along with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp, to take over acting responsibilities in the Terry Gilliam project Parnassus - L&apos;uomo che voleva ingannare il diavolo (2009) following Heath Ledger&apos;s death.Law is a partner in the production company &quot;Natural Nylon&quot;. His partners include Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan McGregor and his ex-wife Sadie Frost.Law has been active in many charitable activities and supports several different foundations and causes, doing work for organizations including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Make Poverty History, Breast Cancer Care and others. Law is also a peace advocate, and in 2011, participated in street protests against the rule of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus.Law married Sadie Frost in 1997 and the couple had two sons (Rafferty and Rudy) and a daughter (Iris) before divorcing in 2003. Law and Alfie (2004) co-star Sienna Miller were engaged to be married in 2005 and separated in 2006 (they would later rekindle their relationship in 2009, splitting once again in 2011). Law and American model Samantha Burke had a brief relationship in 2008 that resulted in the birth of Law&apos;s fourth child, daughter Sophia. Law&apos;s fifth child, with an ex-girlfriend, Catherine Harding, was born in 2015.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1908-03-25</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An important British filmmaker, David Lean was born in Croydon on March 25, 1908 and brought up in a strict Quaker family (ironically, as a child he wasn&apos;t allowed to go to the movies). During the 1920s, he briefly considered the possibility of becoming an accountant like his father before finding a job at Gaumont British Studios in 1927. He worked as tea boy, clapper boy, messenger, then cutting room assistant. By 1935, he had become chief editor of Gaumont British News until in 1939 when he began to edit feature films, notably for Anthony Asquith, Paul Czinner and Michael Powell. Amongst films he worked on were Pigmalione (1938), Il maggiore Barbara (1941) and Volo senza ritorno (1942).By the end of the 1930s, Lean&apos;s reputation as an editor was very well established. In 1942, NoÃ«l Coward gave Lean the chance to co-direct with him the war film Eroi del mare (1942). Shortly after, with the encouragement of Coward, Lean, cinematographer Ronald Neame and producer &apos;Anthony Havelock-Allan&apos; launched a production company called Cineguild. For that firm Lean first directed adaptations of three plays by Coward: the chronicle La famiglia Gibson (1944), the humorous ghost story Spirito allegro (1945) and, most notably, the sentimental drama Breve incontro (1945). Originally a box-office failure in England, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; was presented at the very first Cannes film festival (1946), where it won almost unanimous praises as well as a Grand Prize.From Coward, Lean switched to Charles Dickens, directing two well-regarded adaptations: Grandi speranze (1946) and Le avventure di Oliver Twist (1948). The latter, starring Alec Guinness in his first major movie role, was criticized by some, however, for potential anti-Semitic inflections. The last two films made under the Cineguild banner were Sogno d&apos;amanti (1949), a romance from a novel by H.G. Wells, and the true crime story L&apos;amore segreto di Madeleine (1950). Neither had a significant impact on critics or audiences.The Cineguild partnership came to an end after a dispute between Lean and Neame. Lean&apos;s first post-Cineguild production was the aviation drama Ali del futuro (1952), a great box-office success in England and his most spectacular movie so far. He followed with two sophisticated comedies based on theatrical plays: Hobson il tiranno (1954) and the Anglo-American co-production Tempo d&apos;estate (1955). Both were well received and &quot;Hobson&apos;s Choice&quot; won the Golden Bear at the 1954 Berlin film festival.Lean&apos;s next movie was pivotal in his career, as it was the first of those grand-scale epics he would become renowned for. Il ponte sul fiume Kwai (1957) was produced by Sam Spiegel from a novel by &apos;Pierre Boulle&apos;, adapted by blacklisted writers Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman. Shot in Ceylon under extremely difficult conditions, the film was an international success and triumphed at the Oscars, winning seven awards, most notably best film and director.Lean and Spiegel followed with an even more ambitious film, Lawrence d&apos;Arabia (1962), based on &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, the autobiography of T.E. Lawrence. Starring relative newcomer Peter O&apos;Toole, this film was the first collaboration between Lean and writer Robert Bolt, cinematographer Freddie Young and composer Maurice Jarre. The shooting itself took place in Spain, Morocco and Jordan over a period of 20 months. Initial reviews were mixed and the film was trimmed down shortly after its world premiÃ¨re and cut even more during a 1971 re-release. Like its predecessor, it won seven Oscars, once again including best film and director.The same team of Lean, Bolt, Young and Jarre next worked on an adaptation of Boris Pasternak&apos;s novel &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; for producer Carlo Ponti. Il dottor Zivago (1965) was shot in Spain and Finland, standing in for revolutionary Russia and, despite divided critics, was hugely successful, as was Jarre&apos;s musical score. The film won five Oscars out of ten nominations, but the statuettes for film and director went to Tutti insieme appassionatamente (1965).Lean&apos;s next movie, the sentimental drama La figlia di Ryan (1970), did not reach the same heights. The original screenplay by Robert Bolt was produced by old associate Anthony Havelock-Allan, and Lean once again secured the collaboration of Freddie Young and Maurice Jarre. The shooting in Ireland lasted about a year, much longer than expected. The film won two Oscars; but, for the most part, critical reaction was tepid, sometimes downright derisive, and the general public didn&apos;t really respond to the movie.This relative lack of success seems to have inhibited Lean&apos;s creativity for a while. But towards the end of the 1970s, he started to work again with Robert Bolt on an ambitious two-part movie about the Bounty mutiny. The project fell apart and was eventually recuperated by Dino De Laurentiis. Lean was then approached by producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin to adapt E.M. Forster&apos;s novel &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, a book Lean had been interested in for more than 20 years. For the first time in his career; Lean wrote the adaptation alone, basing himself partly on Santha Rama Rau&apos;s stage version of the book. Lean also acted as his own editor. Passaggio in India (1984) opened to mostly favourable reviews and performed quite well at the box-office. It was a strong Oscar contender, scoring 11 nominations. It settled for two wins, losing the trophy battle to Milos Forman&apos;s Amadeus (1984).Lean spent the last few years of his life preparing an adaptation of Joseph Conrad&apos;s meditative adventure novel &quot;Nostromo&quot;. He also participated briefly in Richard Harris&apos; restoration of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; in 1988. In 1990, Lean received the American Film Institute&apos;s Life Achievement award. He died of cancer on April 16, 1991 at age 83, shortly before the shooting of &quot;Nostromo&quot; was about to begin.Lean was known on sets for his extreme perfectionism and autocratic behavior, an attitude that sometimes alienated his cast or crew. Though his cinematic approach, classic and refined, clearly belongs to a bygone era, his films have aged rather well and his influence can still be found in movies like Il paziente inglese (1996) and Titanic (1997). In 1999, the British Film Institute compiled a list of the 100 favorite British films of the 20th century. Five by David Lean appeared in the top 30, three of them in the top five.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969 in the The Bronx, New York City. Her parents, Lupe LÃ³pez &amp; David LÃ³pez were born in Ponce, Puerto Rico: the second largest Puerto Rican city. The two were brought to the continental United States during their childhoods and, eventually, met while living in New York City. Jennifer is the middle of three musically-inclined sisters, Leslie Scholl, a homemaker, and Lynda Lopez, who is a DJ on New York&apos;s WKTU, a VH1 VJ, and a morning news show correspondent on New York&apos;s Channel 11.Jennifer always dreamed of being a multi-tasking superstar. As a child, she enjoyed a variety of musical genres, mainly Afro-Caribbean rhythms like salsa, merengue and bachata, and mainstream music like pop, hip-hop and R&amp;B. Although she loved music, the film industry also intrigued her. Her biggest influence was the Rita Moreno musical, West Side Story (1961). At age five, Jennifer began taking singing and dancing lessons. Aside from being a budding entertainer, Jennifer was also a Catholic schoolgirl, attending eight years at an all-girls catholic high school named &quot;Holy Family,&quot; located in the Bronx, before graduating from Preston High School after a four-year stay. At school, Jennifer was an amazing athlete and participated in track and field and tennis. At age eighteen, Lopez moved out of her parent&apos;s home. During this time, Lopez worked at a law firm while she took dancing jobs at night.After high school, she briefly worked in a law office. During this time, she continued dance classes at night. At eighteen, she left home because her mother was scared by her decision to pursue show business. Her big break came when she was offered a job as a fly girl on Fox&apos;s hit comedy In Living Color (1990). After a two-year stay at In Living Color (1990) where actress Rosie Perez served as choreographer, Lopez then went on to dance for famed singer-actress Janet Jackson. Her first major film was Gregory Nava&apos;s Mi familia - Tre generazioni di sogni (1995), and her career went into over-drive when she portrayed slain Tejana singer Selena Quintanilla Perez in Selena (1997).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Traci Lords is a study of a determined and complex woman with a very controversial background. She was born and raised in Ohio as Nora Louise Kuzma, to Patricia Louise (Kuzma) and Louis Kuzma. She moved with her divorced mother and three sisters to Los Angeles at age 12. While staying at the house of her mother&apos;s boyfriend, Roger, she began nude modeling at age 15, then adult films a year later.An incredibly developed, full-figured girl, she easily duped photographers, producers and directors (with the help of a false birth certificate and driver&apos;s license). Her stage name is a combination of Traci, from a former school friend, and Lords, in honor of her favorite male actor, Jack Lord (Hawaii Five-O (1968)). She later owned a white Persian cat named Mr. Steve McGarrett, the name of the character Lord played on the show. Traci made somewhere between 80 and 100 X-rated movies (some consisted mostly of leftover footage from previous shoots) between 1984 and 1986.In May 1986 she was arrested by FBI agents when it was discovered she was underage, which meant that any films with her in them were illegal to rent or buy, and video stores around the country rushed to remove them. The only legal porn movie Traci made was Traci, I Love You (1987), which was filmed in Paris, France, on her 18th birthday. Since she controlled distribution rights, many people believed she orchestrated the revelation herself so she could be the only one to profit from her X-rated career. Many within the adult film industry made a tacit agreement to never promote Traci or talk about her, as they felt she betrayed the industry that had had been the source of her fame in the first place. The federal government tried to prosecute the producers of the movie Those Young Girls (1984), the first adult film Traci appeared in, for child pornography. However, the case fell apart when the government admitted that it, too, had been duped when Lords traveled to Europe to shoot Traci, I Love You (1987) on a fake passport. After her exile from adult films, she began to resurrect her life and fulfill her lifelong ambition to star in &quot;mainstream&quot; films.In 1987 she enrolled in the Lee Strasberg acting school, began voice lessons and built on her natural acting talents. Her first mainstream &quot;break&quot; came in Not of This Earth (1988), a remake of the classic Roger Corman sci-fi film from the 1950s. It was the last time that Traci would bare her breasts for the camera.Throughout the 1990s her hard work got her a reputation as a reliable and respected actress, in addition to being a singer and an advocate for gay rights. Her recurring role in early 1995 as a sneering sociopath, Rikki, on Melrose Place (1992) was critically acclaimed and landed her more roles in other movies, playing villains and psychotic characters. In the latter half of the 1990s she appeared in several B movies that went straight to video and/or cable in lead, minor or cameo roles. She even guest-starred in a number of TV shows ranging from Sposati con figli (1987), Pappa e ciccia (1988), MacGyver (1985) and Nash Bridges (1996).She has always despised being referred to as &quot;an ex-porn star&quot;, and resents the fact that a celebrity like Tim Allen can be forgiven by Hollywood for past transgressions (he was convicted and served prison time selling drugs while he was in college) but she still to this day bears the stigma of her porn years. It&apos;s probably the fantasy of the underage girl who fooled an entire industry, and, at the height of her career, was unquestionably the most popular actress with fans and filmmakers alike.Some of her most notable TV work was as a regular on season 2 of Profiler - intuizioni mortali (1996) from 1997 to 1998 in playing the schizo-sicko serial killer Sharon Lesher, as well as the tough heroine Jordan Radcliffe during the last season of the sci-fi series First Wave (1998) from 2000 to 2001. She most recently has written her autobiography, published in 2003, and even tried her hand in writing and directing a short film which would lead her to another career as a writer-director of independent films.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">George Walton Lucas, Jr. was raised on a walnut ranch in Modesto, California. His father was a stationery store owner and he had three siblings. During his late teen years, he went to Thomas Downey High School and was very much interested in drag racing. He planned to become a professional racecar driver. However, a terrible car accident just after his high school graduation ended that dream permanently. The accident changed his views on life.He decided to attend Modesto Junior College before enrolling in the University of Southern California film school. As a film student, he made several short films including Electronic Labyrinth THX 1138 4EB (1967) which won first prize at the 1967-68 National Student Film Festival. In 1967, he was awarded a scholarship by Warner Brothers to observe the making of Sulle ali dell&apos;arcobaleno (1968) which was being directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas and Coppola became good friends and formed American Zoetrope in 1969. The company&apos;s first project was Lucas&apos; full-length version of L&apos;uomo che fuggÃ¬ dal futuro (1971). In 1971, Coppola went into production for Il padrino (1972), and Lucas formed his own company, Lucasfilm Ltd.In 1973, he wrote and directed the semiautobiographical American Graffiti (1973) which won the Golden Globe and garnered five Academy Award nominations. This gave him the clout he needed for his next daring venture. From 1973 to 1974, he began writing the screenplay which became Guerre stellari (1977). He was inspired to make this movie from Flash Gordon and the Planet of the Apes films. In 1975, he established ILM. (Industrial Light &amp; Magic) to produce the visual effects needed for the movie. Another company called Sprocket Systems was established to edit and mix Star Wars and later becomes known as Skywalker Sound. His movie was turned down by several studios until 20th Century Fox gave him a chance. Lucas agreed to forego his directing salary in exchange for 40% of the film&apos;s box-office take and all merchandising rights. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned seven Academy Awards. It redefined the term &quot;blockbuster&quot; and the rest is history.Lucas made the other Star Wars films and along with Steven Spielberg created the Indiana Jones series which made box office records of their own. From 1980 to 1985, Lucas was busy with the construction of Skywalker Ranch, built to accommodate the creative, technical, and administrative needs of Lucasfilm. Lucas also revolutionized movie theaters with the THX system which was created to maintain the highest quality standards in motion picture viewing.He went on to produce several more movies that have introduced major innovations in filmmaking technology. He is chairman of the board of the George Lucas Educational Foundation. In 1992, George Lucas was honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his lifetime achievement.He reentered the directing chair with the production of the highly-anticipated Star Wars prequel trilogy beginning with Star Wars: Episodio I - La minaccia fantasma (1999) . The films have been polarizing for fans and critics alike, but were commercially successful and have become a part of culture. The animated spin-off series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) was supervised by Lucas. He sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, making co-chair Kathleen Kennedy president. He has attended the premieres of new Star Wars films and been generally supportive of them.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Dolph Lundgren was born as Hans Lundgren in Stockholm, Sweden, to Sigrid Birgitta (Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Stockholm until the age of 13, when he moved in with his grandparents in Nyland, Ã…ngermanland, Sweden. Despite an early interest in music and the fine arts, Dolph decided to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps and pursue an Engineering degree. After having completed his military service, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.It was in the military when Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. Five years later, he had become a world-class competitor in Japanese Karate and was deeply involved with a discipline that was to become an important part of his life. After graduating High School, Dolph spent considerable time studying in the United States and abroad on various academic scholarships. He attended Washington State University and Clemson University in South Carolina. In 1982, he received a scholarship to complete his Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. In 1983, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world&apos;s top engineering schools.However, that same year, he decided to move to New York City and take up acting. He changed his forename to Dolph. He started studying drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop in Manhattan, not knowing how quickly his life was about to change. His film debut came in 007 - Bersaglio mobile (1985). However, it was his performance in Rocky IV (1985) later that year that definitely got him noticed. After a 9-month audition process among 5,000 hopefuls, he was cast opposite writer-director Sylvester Stallone, as his Russian opponent, &quot;Ivan Drago&quot;. Following the success of Rocky IV (1985), Lundgren moved to Los Angeles and has since starred in more than 30 feature films.Lundgren portrayed the classic action-heroic lead in such films as Gary Goddard&apos;s I dominatori dell&apos;universo (1987), Resa dei conti a Little Tokyo (1991) co-starring Brandon Lee and Blackjack (1998), by Hong-Kong action legend, John Woo. Lundgren has also continued to turning in memorable performances as the main adversary to other action-stars, most notably in I nuovi eroi (1992) opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by Roland Emmerich, as well as Robert Longo&apos;s Johnny Mnemonic (1995) opposite Keanu Reeves. In February 2004, Lundgren directed his first feature film, the thriller The Defender (2004), in which he also starred. In 2005, he directed and starred in yet another feature, The Mechanik (2005) (a.k.a &quot;The Russian Specialist&quot;).In January 2006, he finished principal photography of L&apos;inchiesta (2006), a joint Italian/American/Spanish co-production, directed by Giulio Base, appearing opposite, among others, Daniele Liotti, Max von Sydow and F. Murray Abraham. In 2006, Lundgren starred in Diamond Dogs (2007), a Chinese/American co-production filmed on location in Mongolia. In 2007, he directed a modern day western shot in Texas, Missionary Man (2007). In 2009, he completed two new directorial efforts, the action-packed Command Performance (2009), which showcases Lundgren&apos;s longtime musical talents as a drummer; and the neo-noir thriller Icarus (2010). Lundgren also reunited with co-stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sylvester Stallone for Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and the highly anticipated action blockbuster, I mercenari - The Expendables (2010).Lundgren managed to not let his Hollywood career stand in the way of his athletic background. He has been awarded his Third Degree Black Belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. His accomplishments include being the Captain of the Swedish National Karate Team, as well as a Champion of the Swedish, European and Australian Heavyweight Division titles. Lundgren still regularly performs Karate exhibitions at international tournaments worldwide. In addition, he was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team during the Atlanta Games. He is actively involved in promoting the image of this sport. His production company, Thor Pictures, is developing several projects in which he will produce, star and/or direct. He is also a founding member of &quot;Group of Eight&quot;, a New York theater group started in 1994.Lundgren has reportedly been working on a fitness book and sports wear line for men, the creation and launch of a new eponymous brand, a licensing, media and publishing program, and the development of future entertainment and media projects. Lundgren was married to Anette Qviberg-Lundgren, an interior decorator and fashion designer, until their divorce in 2011. They had two daughters together.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in precisely the kind of small-town American setting so familiar from his films, David Lynch spent his childhood being shunted from one state to another as his research scientist father kept getting relocated. He attended various art schools, married Peggy Lynch and then fathered future director Jennifer Lynch shortly after he turned 21. That experience, plus attending art school in a particularly violent and run-down area of Philadelphia, inspired Eraserhead - La mente che cancella (1977), a film that he began in the early 1970s (after a couple of shorts) and which he would work on obsessively for five years. The final film was initially judged to be almost unreleasable weird, but thanks to the efforts of distributor Ben Barenholtz, it secured a cult following and enabled Lynch to make his first mainstream film (in an unlikely alliance with Mel Brooks), though The Elephant Man (1980) was shot through with his unique sensibility. Its enormous critical and commercial success led to Dune (1984), a hugely expensive commercial disaster, but Lynch redeemed himself with the now classic Velluto blu (1986), his most personal and original work since his debut. He subsequently won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival with the dark, violent road movie Cuore selvaggio (1990), and achieved a huge cult following with his surreal TV series I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990), which he adapted for the big screen, though his comedy series On the Air (1992) was less successful. He also draws comic strips and has devised multimedia stage events with regular composer Angelo Badalamenti. He had a much-publicized affair with Isabella Rossellini in the late 1980s.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The remarkable, hyper-ambitious Material Girl who never stops reinventing herself, Madonna is a seven-time Grammy Award-winner who has sold over three hundred million records and CDs to adoring fans worldwide. Her film career, however, is another story. Her performances have consistently drawn scathing or laughable reviews from film critics, and the films have usually had tepid, if any, success at the box office. Born Madonna Louise Ciccone in August 1958 in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York in 1978 and studied with renowned choreographer Alvin Ailey, joined up with the Patrick Hernandez Revue, formed a pop/dance band called &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; and began working with then-boyfriend Stephen Bray on recording several disco-oriented songs. New York producer/D.J. Mark Kamins passed her demo tapes to Sire Records in early 1982 and the rest is history. The 1980s was Madonna&apos;s boom decade, and she dominated the music charts with a succession of multimillion-selling albums, and her musical and fashion influence on young women was felt around the globe. Madonna first appeared on screen in two low-budget films marketed to an adolescent audience: L&apos;oggetto del desiderio (1979) and Crazy for You (1985). However, she scored a minor cult hit with Cercasi Susan disperatamente (1985) starring alongside spunky Rosanna Arquette. Madonna&apos;s next effort with then husband Sean Penn, Shanghai Surprise (1986), was savaged by critics, although the resilient star managed to somewhat improve her standing with her next two films, the off-beat Who&apos;s That Girl (1987) (although she did receive decidedly mixed reviews, they weren&apos;t as negative as those of her previous effort) and the quirky Damon Runyon-inspired I maledetti di Broadway (1989). The big-budget and star-filled Dick Tracy (1990) had her playing bad girl &quot;Breathless Mahoney&quot; flirting with Warren Beatty, but the epic failed to catch fire at the box office. Taking an earthier role, Madonna was much more entertaining alongside Tom Hanks and Geena Davis in Ragazze vincenti (1992), a story about female baseball players during W.W.II. However, she again drew the wrath of critics with the whodunit Body of Evidence - Il corpo del reato (1992), an obvious (and lame) attempt to cash in on the success of the sexy Sharon Stone thriller Basic Instinct (1992). Several other minor screen roles followed, then Madonna starred as Eva PerÃ³n in Evita (1996), a fairly well received screen adaptation of the hugely successful Broadway musical, for which she received a Golden Globe for Best Actress. The Material Girl stayed away from the movie cameras for several years, returning to co-star in the lukewarm romantic comedy Sai che c&apos;Ã¨ di nuovo? (2000), followed by the painful Travolti dal destino (2002) for husband Guy Ritchie. If those films weren&apos;t bad enough, she was woefully miscast as a vampish fencing instructor in the James Bond adventure La morte puÃ² attendere (2002). After finally admitting that her acting days were over, Madonna began a directing career in 2008 with the barely remembered Sacro e profano (2008) and a year later she reunited with A letto con Madonna (1991) director Alek Keshishian to develop a script about the relationship between the Duke of Windsor and the Duchess of Windsor that led to his abdication in 1936: the result, a movie named W.E. - Edward e Wallis (2011), starring James D&apos;Arcy and Andrea Riseborough as the infernal but still royal couple, was released in 2011 to lukewarm critics but it gathered one Oscar nomination for costumes and won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for &quot;Masterpiece&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">American actor and producer Matthew David McConaughey was born in Uvalde, Texas. His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Irish, Scottish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father&apos;s oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book &quot;The Greatest Salesman in the World&quot; before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama La vita Ã¨ un sogno (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Non aprite quella porta IV (1995), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite RenÃ©e Zellweger.Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Stella solitaria (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham&apos;s novel Il momento di uccidere (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry&apos;s hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis&apos; Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg&apos;s Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew&apos;s birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998).In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow&apos;s U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as Prima o poi mi sposo (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and Come farsi lasciare in 10 giorni (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Il regno del fuoco (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy A casa con i suoi (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin &quot;Finn&quot; Finnegan in Tutti pazzi per l&apos;oro (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in La rivolta delle ex (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective &quot;Killer&quot; Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey&apos;s career certainly reached it&apos;s prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese&apos;s The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO&apos;s True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics&apos; Choice Award for the role.Also in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan&apos;s sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ewan Gordon McGregor was born on March 31, 1971 in Perth, Perthshire, Scotland, to Carol Diane (Lawson) and James Charles McGregor, both teachers. His uncle is actor Denis Lawson. He was raised in Crieff. At age 16, he left Morrison Academy to join the Perth Repertory Theatre. His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London&apos;s Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside Daniel Craig and Alistair McGowan, among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in Dennis Potter&apos;s six-part Channel 4 series Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). His first notable role was that of Alex Law in Piccoli omicidi tra amici (1994), directed by Danny Boyle, written by John Hodge and produced by Andrew Macdonald. This was followed by I racconti del cuscino (1996) and Trainspotting (1996), the latter of which brought him to the public&apos;s attention.He is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation, and portrays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first three Star Wars episodes. McGregor is married to French production designer Eve Mavrakis, whom he met while working on the television series Kavanagh QC (1995). They married in France in the summer of 1995, and have four daughters. McGregor formed a production company, with friends Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Jude Law, Sadie Frost, Damon Bryant, Bradley Adams and Geoff Deehan, called &quot;Natural Nylon&quot;, and hoped it would make innovative films that do not conform to Hollywood standards. McGregor and Bryant left the company in 2002. He was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Queen&apos;s New Years Honours List for his services to drama and charity.Ewan made his directorial debut with American Pastoral (2016), an adaptation of Philip Roth&apos;s book, in which Ewan also starred.In 2018 McGregor won an Golden Globe for his work in the TV Series Fargo.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alyssa Milano comes from an Italian-American family; her mother Lin Milano is a fashion designer and father Thomas Milano is a film music editor. Alyssa was born in a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn and grew up in a modest house on Staten Island. One day her babysitter, who was an aspiring dancer, dragged Alyssa along to an open audition for the first national tour of &quot;Annie&quot;. However, it was Alyssa and not the sitter who was chosen from 1500 other girls for the role. So at the tender age of seven, with her mother in tow, Alyssa joined the tour as July, one of the orphans. After 18 months on the road Alyssa, who had begun to garner a reputation as an energetic and charismatic young actress, left Annie to be featured in off-Broadway productions and television commercials. Then in 1983, at age 10, she landed her breakthrough role on the sitcom Casalingo SuperpiÃ¹ (1984) as Tony Danza&apos;s saccharine sweet daughter, &quot;Samantha Micelli&quot;, a kid whose native Brooklyn accent rivaled her TV dad&apos;s. In order for Alyssa to accept the gig, the Milano family had to uproot and move 3,000 miles to Hollywood.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Demi Moore was born 1962 in Roswell, New Mexico. Her father Charles Harmon left her mother Virginia King before Demi was born. Her stepfather Danny Guynes didn&apos;t add much stability to her life either. He frequently changed jobs and made the family move a total of 40 times. The parents kept on drinking, arguing and beating, until Guynes finally committed suicide. Demi quit school at the age of 16 to work as a pin-up-girl. At 18 she married rock musician Freddy Moore; the marriage lasted four years. At 19 she became a regular on the soap opera General Hospital (1963). From the first salaries she started partying and sniffing cocaine. That lasted more than 3 years, until director Joel Schumacher threatened to fire her from the set of St. Elmo&apos;s Fire (1985) when she turned up high. She got a withdrawal treatment and returned clean after a week... and stayed clean. With determination and a skill for publicity stunts, like the nude appearance on cover of Vanity Fair while pregnant, she made her way to fame. Since the huge commercial success of Ghost - Fantasma (1990) and the controversial pictures Proposta indecente (1993) and Rivelazioni (1994) she&apos;s one of Hollywood&apos;s most sought-after and most expensive actresses.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Julianne Moore was born Julie Anne Smith in Fort Bragg, North Carolina on December 3, 1960, the daughter of Anne (Love), a social worker, and Peter Moore Smith, a paratrooper, colonel, and later military judge. Her mother moved to the U.S. in 1951, from Greenock, Scotland. Her father, from Burlington, New Jersey, has German, Irish, Welsh, German-Jewish, and English ancestry.Moore spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents, during her father&apos;s military career. She finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), She took the stage name &quot;Julianne Moore&quot; because there was another actress named &quot;Julie Anne Smith&quot;. Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress&apos; trap of the mid-1980&apos;s: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial Ai confini della notte (1956) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap CosÃ¬ gira il mondo (1956). This performance later led to an Outstanding IngÃ©nue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as Money, Power, Murder. (1989), Un difficile addio (1991) and Omicidi e incantesimi (1991).She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990&apos;s I delitti del gatto nero (1990), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in La mano sulla culla (1992) and the comedy La pistola nella borsetta (1992). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as a doctor who spots Kimble Harrison Ford and attempts to thwart his escape in Il fuggitivo (1993). (A role that made such an impression on Steven Spielberg that he cast her in the Jurassic Park (1993) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore&apos;s most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her &quot;beguiling Yelena&quot; from Andre Gregory&apos;s workshop version of Chekhov&apos;s Uncle Vanya in Louis Malle&apos;s critically acclaimed Vanya sulla 42esima strada (1994). Director Todd Haynes gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in Safe (1995). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination.Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as Hugh Grant&apos;s pregnant girlfriend in Nine Months - Imprevisti d&apos;amore (1995). Following films included Assassins (1995), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas) and Surviving Picasso (1996), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, Anthony Hopkins). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg&apos;s Il mondo perduto - Jurassic Park (1997), opposite Jeff Goldblum, a young and unknown director, Paul Thomas Anderson asked Julianne to appear in his movie, Boogie Nights - L&apos;altra Hollywood (1997). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in Il grande Lebowski (1998), continued with a small role in the social comedy Hellcab - Un inferno di taxi (1997) and ended with a subtle performance in Gus Van Sant&apos;s remake of Psyco (1960). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be.As the century closed, Julianne starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with Robert Altman&apos;s La fortuna di Cookie (1999) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged Glenn Close. A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in Oliver Parker&apos;s Un marito ideale (1999) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in Magnolia (1999) and continued with an outstanding performance in Fine di una storia (1999), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in La mappa del mondo (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jack Nicholson, an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter, is a three-time Academy Award winner and twelve-time nominee. Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received an Oscar nomination in every decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s.Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show business. Jack&apos;s mother&apos;s ancestry was Irish, and smaller amounts of English, German, Scottish, and Welsh.Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including The Little Shop of Horrors (1960).Nicholson&apos;s first turn in the director&apos;s chair was for Yellow 33 (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for Il serpente di fuoco (1967), and co-wrote Sogni perduti (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Easy Rider (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson&apos;s film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Cinque pezzi facili (1970). Nicholson&apos;s other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski&apos;s noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar.The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick&apos;s adaptation of Stephen King&apos;s novel Shining (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Voglia di tenerezza (1983), which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; L&apos;onore dei Prizzi (1985), and Le streghe di Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton&apos;s Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as Codice d&apos;onore (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Mars Attacks! (1996).Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson&apos;s acting range reappeared in The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006), the actor&apos;s most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in Qualcosa Ã¨ cambiato (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in A proposito di Schmidt (2002), Tutto puÃ² succedere - Something&apos;s Gotta Give (2003), and Non Ã¨ mai troppo tardi (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute&apos;s Life Achievement award in 1994.Nicholson has five children: Eldest daughter Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963), from his marriage to Sandra Knight, which ended in 1968; Caleb James Goddard (b. 1970) with Susan Anspach; Honey Hollman (b. 1981) with Danish supermodel, Winnie Hollman; and Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with Rebecca Broussard. Nicholson&apos;s longest relationship was the 17 years he spent with actress Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard become pregnant with his child.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Gary Oldman is a talented English movie star and character actor, renowned for his expressive acting style. One of the most celebrated thespians of his generation, with a diverse career encompassing theatre, film and television, he is known for his roles as Sid Vicious in Sid e Nancy (1986), Drexl in Una vita al massimo (1993), George Smiley in La talpa (2011), and Winston Churchill in L&apos;ora piÃ¹ buia (2017), among many others. For much of his career, he was best-known for playing over-the-top antagonists, such as terrorist Egor Korshunov in the 1997 blockbuster Air Force One (1997), though he has reached a new audience with heroic roles in the Harry Potter and Dark Knight franchises. He is also a filmmaker, musician, and author.Gary Leonard Oldman was born on March 21, 1958 in New Cross, London, England, to Kathleen (Cheriton), a homemaker, and Leonard Bertram Oldman, a welder. He won a scholarship to Britain&apos;s Rose Bruford Drama College, in Sidcup, Kent, where he received a B.A. in theatre arts in 1979. He subsequently studied with the Greenwich Young People&apos;s Theatre and went on to appear in a number of plays throughout the early &apos;80s, including &quot;The Pope&apos;s Wedding,&quot; for which he received Time Out&apos;s Fringe Award for Best Newcomer of 1985-1986 and the British Theatre Association&apos;s Drama Magazine Award as Best Actor for 1985. Before fame, he was employed as a worker in assembly lines, and as a porter in an operating theater. He also got jobs selling shoes and beheading pigs while supporting his early acting career.His film debut was Remembrance (1982), though his most-memorable early role came when he played Sex Pistol Sid Vicious in the biopic Sid e Nancy (1986) picking up the Evening Standard Film Award as Best Newcomer. He then received a Best Actor nomination from BAFTA for his portrayal of &apos;60s playwright Joe Orton in Prick Up - L&apos;importanza di essere Joe (1987).In the 1990s, Oldman brought to life a series of iconic real-world and fictional villains including Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991), the title character in Dracula di Bram Stoker (1992), Drexl Spivey in Una vita al massimo (1993), Stansfield in LÃ©on (1994), Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg in Il quinto elemento (1997) and Ivan Korshunov in Air Force One (1997). That decade also saw Oldman portraying Ludwig van Beethoven in biopic Amata immortale (1994).Oldman played the coveted role of Sirius Black in Harry Potter e il prigioniero di Azkaban (2004), giving him a key part in one of the highest-grossing franchises ever. He reprised that role in Harry Potter e il calice di fuoco (2005) and Harry Potter e l&apos;Ordine della Fenice (2007). Oldman also took on the iconic role of Detective James Gordon in writer-director Christopher Nolan&apos;s Batman Begins (2005), a role he played again in Il cavaliere oscuro (2008) and Il cavaliere oscuro - Il ritorno (2012). Prominent film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing The Dark Knight, wrote, &quot;the best performance in the film, by a mile, is Gary Oldman&apos;s ... it would be lovely to see him get a[n Academy Award] nomination because actually, he&apos;s the guy who gets kind of overlooked in all of this.&quot;Oldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol in which Oldman played three roles. He had a starring role in David Goyer&apos;s supernatural thriller The Unborn, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Book of Eli.

Oldman voiced the role of villain Lord Shen and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance in Kung Fu Panda 2.In 2011, Oldman portrayed master spy George Smiley in the adaptation of John le CarrÃ©&apos;s La talpa (2011), and the role scored Oldman his first Academy Award nomination. In 2014, he played one of the lead humans in the science fiction action film Apes Revolution - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2014). Also in 2014, Oldman starred alongside Joel Kinnaman, Abbie Cornish, Michael Keaton, and Samuel L. Jackson in the remake of RoboCop (2014), as Norton, the scientist who creates RoboCop.

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1940-04-25</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alfredo James &quot;Al&quot; &apos;Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema&apos;s most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.He was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents&apos; home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz&apos;s &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for &quot;Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot; His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in Panico a Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in Il padrino (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O&apos;Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.Coppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Quel pomeriggio di un giorno da cani (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the &quot;Best Actor&quot; Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Un attimo una vita (1977), but regained his stride with ...e giustizia per tutti (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like Cruising (1980) and PapÃ , sei una frana (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Seduzione pericolosa (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino&apos;s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made Il padrino - Parte III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Americani (1992). He went into romantic mode for Paura d&apos;amare (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman - Profumo di donna (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito&apos;s Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat - La sfida (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s Riccardo III - Un uomo, un re (1996). During this period, City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and L&apos;avvocato del diavolo (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in Insider - Dietro la veritÃ  (1999) and Ogni maledetta domenica (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie You Don&apos;t Know Jack - Il dottor morte (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.Never wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D&apos;Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with &quot;Godfather&quot; co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila SolÃ¡, who is 36 years his junior.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Bill Paxton was born on May 17, 1955 in Fort Worth, Texas. He was the son of Mary Lou (Gray) and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and actor (as John Paxton). Bill moved to Los Angeles, California at age eighteen, where he found work in the film industry as a set dresser for Roger Corman&apos;s New World Pictures. He made his film debut in the Corman film Crazy Mama (1975), directed by Jonathan Demme. Moving to New York, Paxton studied acting under Stella Adler at New York University. After landing a small role in Stripes - Un plotone di svitati (1981), he found steady work in low-budget films and television. He also directed, wrote and produced award-winning short films including Barnes &amp; Barnes: Fish Heads (1980), which aired on Il Saturday Night Live (1975). His first appearance in a James Cameron film was a small role in Terminator (1984), followed by his very memorable performance as Private Hudson in Aliens - Scontro finale (1986) and as the nomadic vampire Severen in Kathryn Bigelow&apos;s Il buio si avvicina (1987). Bill also appeared in John Hughes&apos; La donna esplosiva (1985), as Wyatt Donnelly&apos;s sadistic older brother Chet. Although he continued to work steadily in film and television, his big break did not come until his lead role in the critically acclaimed film-noir Qualcuno sta per morire (1992). This quickly led to strong supporting roles as Wyatt Earp&apos;s naive younger brother Morgan in Tombstone (1993) and as Fred Haise, one of the three astronauts, in Apollo 13 (1995), as well as in James Cameron&apos;s offering True Lies (1994).Bill died on February 25, 2017, in Los Angeles, from complications following heart surgery. He was 61.</rdfs:comment>

Her father had German and British Isles ancestry, and her mother was of half Swiss-German and half Swedish descent.Pfeiffer graduated from Fountain Valley High School in 1976, and attended one year at the Golden West College, where she studied to become a court reporter.

She was married to actor/director Peter Horton (&quot;Gary&quot; of In famiglia e con gli amici (1987)) in 1981. They were later divorced, and she then had a three year relationship with actor Fisher Stevens.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">River Phoenix was born River Jude Bottom in Madras, Oregon. His mother, Arlyn (Dunetz), a Bronx-born secretary, and his father, John Bottom, a carpenter, met in California in 1968. They worked as itinerant fruit pickers, and later joined the Children of God religious group (John was originally Catholic, while Arlyn was born Jewish). By the time River was two, they were living in South America, where John was the sect&apos;s Archbishop of Venezuela. They later left the group and, in 1977, moved back to the United States, changing their last name to &quot;Phoenix&quot;. They lived with River&apos;s maternal grandparents in Florida, and later moved to Los Angeles. His parents encouraged all of their children to get into movies and, by age ten, River was acting professionally on TV. His film debut was in Explorers (1985), followed rapidly by box-office successes with Stand by Me - Ricordo di un&apos;estate (1986) and Mosquito Coast (1986), and as young Indiana in Indiana Jones e l&apos;ultima crociata (1989). His role as Danny Pope in Vivere in fuga (1988) earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His best role was probably Mike, the hustler in Belli e dannati (1991).A dedicated animal-rights activist and environmentalist, River was a strict vegetarian and a member of PeTA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals).

River was in the middle of filming Dark Blood (2012), playing the character Boy when he died. The film couldn&apos;t be finished due to too many unfilmed crucial scenes. His mother was later sued.River died of acute multiple drug intoxication involving lethal levels of cocaine and morphine at age 23 outside the Viper Room, Johnny Depp&apos;s Los Angeles club.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1964-09-02</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means &quot;cool breeze over the mountains&quot; in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu&apos;s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu&apos;s mother is originally from England. After his parents&apos; marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname &quot;The Wall&quot;) and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Spalle larghe (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics&apos; radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, I ragazzi del fiume (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Le relazioni pericolose (1988) with director Stephen Frears.His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted &quot;Theodore&quot; Logan in Bill &amp; Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves&apos;s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard&apos;s comedy, Parenti, amici e tanti guai (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan&apos;s Ti amerÃ²... fino ad ammazzarti (1990).Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix&apos;s narcoleptic male hustler in Belli e dannati (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire&apos;s lair in Dracula di Bram Stoker (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Molto rumore per nulla (1993).In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Due mariti per un matrimonio (1996) and L&apos;ultima volta che mi sono suicidato (1997), and big films like Il profumo del mosto selvatico (1995) and L&apos;avvocato del diavolo (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and Reazione a catena (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings&apos; cyberadventure, Matrix (1999).Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them Le riserve (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift - Il dono (2000), Sweet November - Dolce novembre (2001), and Hardball (2001) - before Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003.Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Tutto puÃ² succedere - Something&apos;s Gotta Give (2003), La casa sul lago del tempo (2006), and La notte non aspetta (2008). He&apos;s kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly - Un oscuro scrutare (2006), and Ultimatum alla Terra (2008). And he&apos;s waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker - Il succhiapollice (2005), La vita segreta della signora Lee (2009), and Henry&apos;s Crime (2010).Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Rivoluzione digitale (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013).In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick - Capitolo 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Julia Fiona Roberts never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. She was born in Smyrna, Georgia, to Betty Lou (Bredemus) and Walter Grady Roberts, one-time actors and playwrights, and is of English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, Eric Roberts, achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies Mystic Pizza (1988) and Femmine sfrenate (1988). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia&apos;s biggest success was in the signature movie Pretty Woman (1990), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People&apos;s Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With Il matrimonio del mio migliore amico (1997) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several actors, and married cinematographer Daniel Moder in 2002; the couple has three children together.Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia Robert remains one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It&apos;s fair to say that after 20 years and over 50 film appearances, Mimi Rogers should be praised for her variety of roles and acting capabilities, not for a brief marriage to a Hollywood star. In the early 1980s she began to carve a niche for herself in Hollywood, appearing on television and in films. It was her role in Chi protegge il testimone (1987) that got her noticed and was her springboard to stardom. Cemented by a marriage to Tom Cruise, an already established young actor, Mimi went on to appear in L&apos;intruso (1989), Ore disperate (1990), and The Doors (1991). She appeared in a controversial movie analyzing religion in America, Sacrificio fatale (1991), which proved a hit and delighted audiences, creating many a debate over the film&apos;s subject material. She played a bored telephone exchange operator who swaps a sinful life of sex and swinging with other couples for a devout religious one, ending unexpectedly in disaster. Despite her successes, few meaty, interesting roles came her way in the &apos;90s. Una moglie di troppo (1992), opposite Jeff Goldblum, the family movie Il mio amico zampalesta (1994), Lontano da casa (1995), and Il massaggio dell&apos;anima (1995) were just a few of the films that she appeared in. Working consistently, she rejuvenated her career in the unexpected hit Austin Powers - Il controspione (1997), playing Miss Kensington, an attractive female agent of 1960s London and the mother of Elizabeth Hurley&apos;s character. Next, Mimi was seen in the big-screen remake of the &apos;60s sci-fi TV series Lost in Space (1998) and several guest appearances on the hugely popular television series X-Files (1993), playing a scheming FBI agent. A role in the Canadian indie-horror Licantropia Evolution - Ritorno al presente (2000) did her career no harm. Soon, she was opposite Geena Davis in The Geena Davis Show (2000) from 2000-01 and playing an extremely rich Manhattan socialite in the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000).More recently Mimi has appeared on cable television, including leading roles in Charms for the Easy Life (2002) (which she also executive produced) and Intrappolati al centro della Terra (2003) (a true-life disaster drama in which she played the Chief Superintendent of a mine). In 2004, she gave a revealing performance in The Door in the Floor (2004), a critical success. The Loop (2006), a Chicago-based sitcom, will soon be airing in America, featuring Mimi as a flirtatious office worker. Also in 2006, Mimi will be appearing in an original horror film, Penny Dreadful (2006), playing a psychiatrist in peril. In 2003, she married her longtime boyfriend Chris Ciaffa, with whom she has a son and a daughter. A poker novice, Mimi also travels around competing in tournaments, some televised.</rdfs:comment>

She is the daughter of Cynthia (Istas), an author and video producer, and Michael Horowitz, a publisher and bookseller. Her father&apos;s family is Russian Jewish and Romanian Jewish. She grew up in a ranch commune in Northern California which had no electricity. She is the goddaughter of Timothy Leary. Her parents were friends of Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and once edited a book called &quot;Shaman Woman Mainline Lady&quot;, an anthology of writings on the drug experience in literature, which included one piece by Louisa May Alcott. Ryder would later play the lead role of Josephine March in the adaptation of this author&apos;s novel Piccole donne (1994).Ryder moved with her parents to Petaluma, California when she was ten and enrolled in acting classes at the American Conservatory Theater. At age 13, she had a video audition to the film Un fiore nel deserto (1986), but did not get the role. However, director David Seltzer spotted her and cast her in Lucas (1986). When telephoned to ask how she would like to have her name appear on the credits, she suggested Ryder as her father&apos;s Mitch Ryder album was playing the background. Ryder was selected for the role of Mary Corleone in Il padrino - Parte III (1990), but had to drop out of the role after catching the flu from the strain of doing the films Roxy - Il ritorno di una stella (1990) and Sirene (1990) back to back. She said she did not want to let everyone down by doing a substandard performance. She later made L&apos;etÃ  dell&apos;innocenza (1993), which was directed by Martin Scorsese, whom she believes to be &quot;the best director in the world&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

She is of Italian descent on her mother&apos;s side and English, Irish, Welsh, and German on her father&apos;s.After the 1968 Democratic convention there was a casting call for a film with several roles for the kind of young people who had disrupted the convention. Two recent graduates of Catholic University in Washington DC, went to an audition in New York for La guerra del cittadino Joe (1970), Chris Sarandon (who was passed over) and his wife Susan. Chris brought her along on the audition and she got her big break with a major role: Susan Compton, the daughter of ad executive Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick). In the movie Bill kills Susan&apos;s drug-dealer boyfriend, then befriends Joe (Peter Boyle)-- a bigot who works on an assembly line and collects guns.Five years later, Sarandon made the film where fans of cult classics have come to know her as Janet, who gets entangled with transvestite Dr. Frank N. Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). More than 15 years after beginning her career Sarandon at last actively campaigned for a great role, Annie in Bull Durham - Un gioco a tre mani (1988), flying at her own expense from Rome to Los Angeles. &quot;It was such a wonderful script ... and did away with a lot of myths and challenged the American definition of success&quot;, she said. &quot;When I got there, I spent some time with Kevin Costner, kissed some ass at the studio and got back on a plane&quot;. Her romance with the Bull Durham - Un gioco a tre mani (1988) supporting actor, Tim Robbins, had produced two sons by 1992 and put Sarandon in the position of leaving her domestic paradise only to accept roles that really challenged her. The result was four Academy Award nominations in the 1990s and best actress for Dead Man Walking - Condannato a morte (1995). Her first Academy Award nomination was for Louis Malle&apos;s Atlantic City (1980).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1947-07-30</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood&apos;s biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true &quot;rags to riches&quot; tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood &quot;freak show&quot; by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of &quot;pumping iron&quot; and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible &quot;Austrian Oak&quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger&apos;s horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as &quot;Arnold Strong&quot; in the low budget Ercole a New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Il gigante della strada (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture&quot;. The mesmerizing Uomo d&apos;acciaio (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Jack del Cactus (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan il barbaro (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the &quot;Hyborean Age&quot; and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, &quot;Conan&quot; was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan il distruttore (1984) quickly followed. If &quot;Conan&quot; was the kick start to Arnold&apos;s movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled PiraÃ±a paura (1981), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase &quot;I&apos;ll be back&quot; quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Commando (1985), Codice Magnum (1986), Predator (1987), L&apos;implacabile (1987) and Danko (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy I gemelli (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as &quot;a condom stuffed with walnuts&quot;. The spectacular Atto di forza (1990) and &quot;feel good&quot; Un poliziotto alle elementari (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2 - Il giorno del giudizio (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film&apos;s $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases &amp; stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2 - Il giorno del giudizio (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold&apos;s film career to date and he was voted &quot;International Star of the Decade&quot; by the National Association of Theatre Owners.Remarkably, his next film Last Action Hero - L&apos;ultimo grande eroe (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the &quot;James Bond&quot; style spy thriller True Lies (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Una promessa Ã¨ una promessa (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with L&apos;eliminatore - Eraser (1996), as the chilling &quot;Mr. Freeze&quot; in Batman &amp; Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of Giorni contati (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale Il 6Â° giorno (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Danni collaterali (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.It was time again to resurrect Arnold&apos;s most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3 - Le macchine ribelli (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of &quot;Sarah Connor&quot; aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing &quot;John Connor&quot; - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the &quot;Terminator&quot; series the weakest to date.Schwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The &quot;Governator,&quot; as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor&apos;s mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family&apos;s live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Il tesoro dell&apos;Amazzonia (2003), Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (2004) and The Kid &amp; I (2005). Recently, he starred in I mercenari 2 (2012), The Last Stand - L&apos;ultima sfida (2013), Escape Plan - Fuga dall&apos;inferno (2013), I mercenari 3 (2014), and Terminator Genisys (2015).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Martin Charles Scorsese was born on November 17, 1942 in Queens, New York City, to Catherine Scorsese (nÃ©e Cappa) and Charles Scorsese, who both worked in Manhattan&apos;s garment district, and whose families both came from Palermo, Sicily. He was raised in the neighborhood of Little Italy, which later provided the inspiration for several of his films. Scorsese earned a B.S. degree in film communications in 1964, followed by an M.A. in the same field in 1966 at New York University&apos;s School of Film. During this time, he made numerous prize-winning short films including The Big Shave (1967), and directed his first feature film, Chi sta bussando alla mia porta? (1967).He served as assistant director and an editor of the documentary Woodstock: tre giorni di pace, amore, e musica (1970) and won critical and popular acclaim for Mean Streets - Domenica in chiesa, lunedÃ¬ all&apos;inferno (1973), which first paired him with actor and frequent collaborator Robert De Niro. In 1976, Scorsese&apos;s Taxi Driver (1976), also starring De Niro, was awarded the Palme d&apos;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and he followed that film with New York, New York (1977) and L&apos;ultimo valzer (1978). Scorsese directed De Niro to an Oscar-winning performance as boxer Jake LaMotta in Toro scatenato (1980), which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and is hailed as one of the masterpieces of modern cinema. Scorsese went on to direct Il colore dei soldi (1986), L&apos;ultima tentazione di Cristo (1988), Quei bravi ragazzi (1990), Cape Fear - Il promontorio della paura (1991), L&apos;etÃ  dell&apos;innocenza (1993), CasinÃ² (1995) and Kundun (1997), among other films. Commissioned by the British Film Institute to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of cinema, Scorsese completed the four-hour documentary, Century of Cinema: Un secolo di cinema - Viaggio nel cinema americano di Martin Scorsese (1995), co-directed by Michael Henry Wilson.His long-cherished project, Gangs of New York (2002), earned numerous critical honors, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Director; the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator (2004) won five Academy Awards, in addition to the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for Best Picture. Scorsese won his first Academy Award for Best Director for The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006), which was also honored with the Director&apos;s Guild of America, Golden Globe, New York Film Critics, National Board of Review and Critic&apos;s Choice awards for Best Director, in addition to four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Scorsese&apos;s documentary of the Rolling Stones in concert, Shine a Light (2008), followed, with the successful thriller Shutter Island (2010) two years later. Scorsese received his seventh Academy Award nomination for Best Director, as well as a Golden Globe Award, for Hugo Cabret (2011), which went on to win five Academy Awards.Scorsese also serves as executive producer on the HBO series Boardwalk Empire: L&apos;impero del crimine (2010) for which he directed the pilot episode. Scorsese&apos;s additional awards and honors include the Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival (1995), the AFI Life Achievement Award (1997), the Honoree at the Film Society of Lincoln Center&apos;s 25th Gala Tribute (1998), the DGA Lifetime Achievement Award (2003), The Kennedy Center Honors (2007) and the HFPA Cecil B. DeMille Award (2010).

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Steven Frederic Seagal was born in Lansing, Michigan, to Patricia Anne (Fisher), a medical technician, and Samuel Seagal, a high school math teacher. His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and his mother had English, German, and distant Irish and Dutch, ancestry. The enigmatic Seagal commenced his martial arts training at the age of seven under the tutelage of well-known karate instructor and author Fumio Demura, and in the 1960s commenced his aikido training in Orange County, CA, under the instruction of Harry Ishisaka. Seagal received his first dan accreditation in 1974, after he had moved to Japan to further his martial arts training. After spending many years there honing his skills, he achieved the ranking of a 7th dan in the Japanese martial art &quot;aikido&quot; and was instructing wealthy clients in Los Angeles when he came to the attention of Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz.Ovitz saw star value in the imposing-looking Seagal. The high-octane action movie genre was in full swing in the late 1980s, and Seagal&apos;s debut movie, &quot;Above the Law&quot;, was wildly received by action fans and actually received some complimentary critical reviews. He followed up &quot;Above the Law&quot; with another slam-bang thriller, Duro da uccidere (1990), as a cop shot in an ambush by the mob who revives from a coma to take his revenge. The movie also starred Seagal&apos;s wife at the time, leggy Kelly LeBrock, who was married to him from 1987 to 1996 and is the mother of three of his children. His next outing was battling voodoo-using Jamaican drug &quot;posses&quot; in the hyper-violent Programmato per uccidere (1990), before returning to fight psychotic mob gangster William Forsythe in the even more punishing Giustizia a tutti i costi (1991). Seagal was by now enormously popular, and his next movie, the big-budgeted Trappola in alto mare (1992), set aboard the battleship USS Missouri and also starring Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, was arguably his best film to date, impressing both fans and critics alike.Seagal&apos;s fighting style was rather different from that of other on-screen martial arts dynamos such as Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme, who were predominantly fighters from striking arts background such as karate or tang soo do. However, aikido is built around using an opponent&apos;s inertia and body weight to employ various locks, chokes and holds that incapacitate him. Seagal carries himself differently, too, and often appears wearing Italian designer clothes and usually favors an all-black outfit, generally with a three-quarter-length coat with an elaborate trim. Additionally, Seagal&apos;s on-screen characters were often seemingly benign or timid individuals; however, when the going gets rough they reveal themselves to be deadly ex-CIA operatives, or retired Special Forces soldiers capable of enormous destruction!As his box-office drawing power grew, Seagal began to infuse his film projects with his personal and spiritual beliefs, especially concerning the abuse of the environment. He appeared as an oil fire expert who turns against his corrupt CEO (played by Michael Caine) in Sfida tra i ghiacci (1994) to save the Eskimo population from an oil disaster; in Fire Down Below - L&apos;inferno sepolto (1997) he plays an environmental agency troubleshooter investigating the dumping of toxic waste in Kentucky coal mines, and in the slow-moving The Patriot (1998) he plays a medical specialist trying to stop a lethal virus unleashed by an extremist group.Action fans struggled to come to terms with social messaging being built into bone-crunching fight films; however, Seagal&apos;s box-office clout remained fairly strong, and more traditional chopsocky projects followed with the &quot;buddy cop&quot; film Delitti inquietanti (1996), then almost a cameo role as a Navy SEAL alongside CIA analyst Kurt Russell before Seagal is sucked out of a jet at 35,000 feet in Decisione critica (1996).In 1999 Seagal took a different turn in his film projects with the surprising genteel Prince of Central Park (2000), about a child living inside NYC&apos;s most famous park. He returned to more familiar territory with further high-voltage, guns-blazing action in Ferite mortali (2001), Infiltrato speciale (2002), Il vendicatore (2003) and Belly of the Beast - Ultima missione (2003).Unbeknownst to many, in 1997 Seagal publicly announced that one of his Buddhist teachers, His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, had accorded Seagal as a tulku, the reincarnation of a Buddhist Lama. This initial announcement was met with some disbelief until Penor Rinpoche himself gave a confirmation statement on Seagal&apos;s new title. Seagal has repeatedly discussed his involvement in Buddhism and how he devotes many hours studying and meditating this ancient Eastern religion.While his box-office appeal has somewhat declined from his halcyon blockbusters of the mid-&apos;90s, Seagal still has a very loyal fan base in the action movie genre and continues to remain a highly bankable star.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Charlie Sheen was born Carlos Irwin EstÃ©vez on September 3, 1965, in New York City. His father, actor Martin Sheen (born Ramon Antonio Gerard Estevez), was at the time just breaking into the business, with performances on Broadway. His mother, Janet Sheen (nÃ©e Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Charlie&apos;s father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Emilio Estevez, RenÃ©e Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.At a young age, Charlie took an interest in his father&apos;s acting career. When he was nine, he was given a small part in his dad&apos;s movie The Execution of Private Slovik (1974). In 1977, he was in the Philippines where his dad suffered a near-fatal heart attack on the set of Apocalypse Now (1979).While at Santa Monica High School, Charlie had two major interests: acting and baseball. Along with his friends, which included Rob Lowe and Sean Penn, he produced and starred in several amateur Super-8 films. On the Vikings baseball team, he was a star shortstop and pitcher. His lifetime record as a pitcher was 40-15. His interest and skill in baseball would later influence some of his movie roles. Unfortunately, his success on the baseball field did not translate to success in the classroom, as he struggled to keep his grades up. Just a few weeks before his scheduled graduation date, Charlie was expelled due to poor attendance and bad grades.After high school, Charlie aggressively pursued many acting roles. His first major role was as a high school student in the teen war film Alba rossa (1984). He followed this up with relatively small roles in TV movies and low-profile releases. His big break came in 1986 when he starred in Oliver Stone&apos;s Oscar winning epic Platoon (1986). He drew rave reviews for his portrayal of a young soldier who is caught in the center of a moral crisis in Vietnam.The success of Platoon (1986) prompted Oliver Stone to cast Charlie in his next movie Wall Street (1987) alongside his father and veteran actor Martin Sheen. The movie with its &quot;Greed is Good&quot; theme became an instant hit with viewers.Shortly after, Stone approached Charlie about the starring role in his next movie, Nato il quattro luglio (1989). When Tom Cruise eventually got the part, Sheen ended up hearing the news from his brother Emilio Estevez and not even getting as much as a call from Stone. This led to a fallout, and the two have not worked together since.The fallout with Stone, however, did nothing to hurt Charlie&apos;s career in the late 1980s and early &apos;90s, as he continued to establish himself as one of the top box office draws with a string of hits that included Young Guns - Giovani pistole (1988), Major League - La squadra piÃ¹ scassata della lega (1989), and Hot Shots! (1991). However, as the mid-&apos;90s neared, his good fortune both personally and professionally, soon came to an end.Around this time, Charlie, who had already been to drug rehab, was beginning to develop a reputation as a hard-partying, womanizer. In 1995, the same year he was briefly married to model Donna Peele, he was called to testify at the trial of Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. At the trial, while under oath he admitted to spending nearly $50,000 on 27 of Fleiss&apos; $2,500-a-night prostitutes.His downward spiral continued the following year when his ex-girlfriend Brittany Ashland filed charges claiming that he physically abused her. He was later charged with misdemeanor battery to which he pleaded no contest and was given a year&apos;s suspended sentence, two years&apos; probation and a $2,800 fine. He finally hit rock bottom in May 1998 when he was hospitalized in Thousand Oaks, California, following a near-fatal drug overdose. Later that month, he was ordered back to the drug rehab center, which he had previously left after one day.During this stretch, Charlie&apos;s film career began to suffer as well. He starred in a series of box office flops that included The Arrival (1996) and Shadow Program - Programma segreto (1997). However as the 1990s came to end, so did Charlie&apos;s string of bad luck.In 2000, Charlie, now clean and sober, was chosen to replace Michael J. Fox on the ABC hit sitcom Spin City (1996). Though his stint lasted only two seasons, Charlie&apos;s performance caught the eye of CBS executives who in 2003 were looking for an established star to help carry their Monday night lineup of sitcoms that included Tutti amano Raymond (1996). The sitcom Due uomini e mezzo (2003) starred Charlie as a swinging, irresponsible womanizer whose life changes when his nephew suddenly appears on his doorstep. The show became a huge hit, breathing much needed life into Charlie&apos;s fading career.Charlie&apos;s personal life also appeared to be improving. In 2002, he married actress Denise Richards, whom he first met while shooting the movie Posta del cuore (2001). In March 2004, they had a daughter, Sam, and it was announced shortly after that Denise was pregnant with the couple&apos;s second child. By all reports, the couple seemed to be very happy together. However, like all of Charlie&apos;s previous relationships, the stability did not last long. In March of 2005, Denise, who was six-months pregnant, filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She gave birth to a second daughter, Lola, in June of that same year. Their divorce became final in late 2006.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&quot;Want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing&quot;. If you have not heard of Brooke Shields before, this tagline from her Calvin Klein Jeans ad had to grab your attention. Not that she has not had a previously noteworthy resume. She was born on May 31, 1965 in New York City and, at age 12, she starred as a child prostitute in Pretty Baby (1978). Could this movie even be made today? It was considered risky and controversial in 1978. It was followed by another blockbuster, the romance adventure drama Laguna blu (1980). Brooke has proved herself to be so much more than her early films. Her broad range of work as an adult would be quite an achievement for anyone, especially given how difficult transitioning from child actor to adult often is.She has never stopped working, whether it be a Bob Hope Christmas special, her own sitcom Susan (1996) or as an author. She also managed to work on a degree from Princeton University. She has received a number of awards during her career, most notably The People&apos;s Choice award for 1981 through 1984 in the category of Favorite Young Performer. In 1997, she was honored again with The People&apos;s Choice award for Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series in 1997 for her work in Susan (1996). In her personal life, she was married in 1997 to tennis player Andre Agassi and was devastated when they divorced two years later. She married for the second time in 2001 to Chris Henchy. She has been open about using fertility treatments to become pregnant with their daughter, Rowan, born in 2003.When suffering debilitating depression after the birth of her daughter, she made the decision to put her feelings down on paper. Her book, &quot;Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression&quot;, takes a hard, honest look at what she and many other women experience after childbirth. She still lives in New York City, and is still sought after for work in movies, television, and on stage. Pretty nice list of achievements for the once Calvin Klein jeans girl.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Elisabeth Shue was born in Wilmington, Delaware, to Anne Brewster (Wells), who worked for the Chemical Banking Corporation, and James William Shue, a lawyer and real estate developer. She is of German and English ancestry, including descent from Mayflower passengers. Shue&apos;s parents divorced while she was in the fourth grade. Owing to the occupational demands of her parents, Shue and her siblings found plenty of time to get into trouble in their suburban neighborhood, but Elisabeth soon enrolled in Wellesley College, an all-female institution which kept her out of trouble.During her studies, she found a way to make a little extra money by acting in television commercials. Elisabeth became a common sight in ads for Burger King, DeBeers diamonds, and Hellman&apos;s mayonnaise. In 1984, she landed a role in the The Karate Kid - Per vincere domani (1984) as the on-screen girlfriend of Ralph Macchio and a role as the teenage daughter of a military family in the short-lived series Call to Glory (1984). At this time, Shue got herself an acting coach and transferred to Harvard, where she began studying political science.She continued her acting work with Tutto quella notte (1987), Cocktail (1988), Bolle di sapone (1991) and Bella, bionda... e dice sempre sÃ¬ (1991). Unfortunately, time was catching up with the impressive girl-next-door. Her brother Andrew Shue had almost eclipsed her own fame by landing a starring role in the hit TV series Melrose Place (1992). It was at this time that Elisabeth took a chance on a low-budget, high-risk project entitled Via da Las Vegas (1995), directed by Mike Figgis. Her gutsy portrayal of a prostitute mixed up with a suicidal alcoholic paid off as she was recognized with a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards that year. This was the turning point of her career. What followed was a barrage of film roles, including Il santo (1997), Woody Allen&apos;s Harry a pezzi (1997), Palmetto - Un torbido inganno (1998) and L&apos;uomo senza ombra (2000).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alicia Silverstone was born on October 4, 1976 in San Francisco, California, the youngest of three children. She is the daughter of Didi (Radford), a former flight attendant, and Monty Silverstone, a real estate investor. Her English-born father is from a Jewish family, while her Scottish-born mother converted to Judaism. Alicia&apos;s career began at the tender age of six, when her father took some photos of his young daughter, which eventually led to her getting several television commercials. After a guest spot on The Wonder Years (1988) as a literal &quot;dream girl&quot;, she moved on to movies. She landed a role in La ragazza della porta accanto (1993), a sort of Attrazione fatale (1987) for teenagers in which she portrayed a disturbed young girl obsessed with an older man. The nasty little role did not impress the critical establishment but it wowed its target audience: teenagers. In fact, the role won her the 1994 MTV Movie Award for &quot;Best Villain&quot; and &quot;Breakthrough Performance&quot;. It is interesting to note that during the filming of the movie, Alicia became an emancipated minor in order to get around child labor laws which would have interfered with her working hours. She was a dedicated actress from early on.The film also caught the attention of Aerosmith, who hired her to appear in a string of their music videos. The first of them, &quot;Cryin&apos;&quot;, was voted the #1 video of all time on MTV. Silverstone was definitely a hit with the MTV crowd, but larger commercial success still eluded her. That all changed when she landed the role of Cher in Amy Heckerling&apos;s Ragazze a Beverly Hills (1995). Cher was the antithesis of Alicia&apos;s role in The Crush; this time around, she was a rich, naive yet endearing girl from Beverly Hills in search of love in the 1990s. The film was a huge box-office hit and wowed both audiences and critics alike and demonstrated Alicia&apos;s strength and bankability. She was hailed as the woman of the hour, and branded the spokeswoman for an emerging young generation. She signed a deal with Columbia TriStar worth $10 million and got the coveted role of Batgirl in the Batman franchise. Also, as part of the package, she received a three-year first-look deal for her own production company, First Kiss Productions. The first film released by First Kiss was Una ragazza sfrenata (1997).</rdfs:comment>

Christian started in show business early, appearing on the soap opera Ai confini della notte (1956) in 1976 at the age of 7. He went on to star in many Broadway shows in the early-1980s. He rose to fame in Hollywood after landing the role of Binx Davey in La leggenda di Billie Jean (1985). He moved to Los Angeles in 1987 to pursue a further acting career after dropping out of high school. After having a starring role in the cult classic Schegge di follia (1989), he became somewhat known as the Hollywood bad-boy, having many run-ins with the law. He is also well-known for having dated stars such as Winona Ryder, Christina Applegate, Samantha Mathis and was at one time engaged to actress/model Nina Huang. In 2000, he married Ryan Haddon, the daughter of 1970s model Dayle Haddon. The couple have two children, Jaden Christopher (b. 1999) and Eliana Sophia (b. 2001). As of early 2005, they separated and later divorced, but remain dedicated to bring up their children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Willard Carroll &quot;Will&quot; Smith, Jr. (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, comedian, producer, rapper, and songwriter. He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him &quot;the most powerful actor in Hollywood&quot;. Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.Smith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.Smith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia&apos;s Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.Smith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he &quot;wanted to rap.&quot; Smith says he was admitted to a &quot;pre-engineering [summer] program&quot; at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, &quot;My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college.&quot;Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey &quot;DJ Jazzy Jeff&quot; Townes as producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably &quot;Parents Just Don&apos;t Understand&quot; and &quot;Summertime&quot;. They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming &quot;the biggest movie star in the world&quot;, studying box office successes&apos; common characteristics. Smith&apos;s first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich&apos;s Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves&apos;s performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he &quot;made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.&quot;In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman&apos;s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be &quot;aggressively unique&quot;. A reviewer said that the film&apos;s commercial success &quot;cemented [Smith&apos;s] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood.&quot; On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America&apos;s top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.In 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa. It was in 2008 that Smith starred in the superhero movie Hancock.Men in Black III opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years.On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game. Smith&apos;s most recent studio album, Lost and Found, was released in 2005.Smith and his son Jaden played father and son in two productions: the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of Happyness, and the science fiction film After Earth, which was released on May 31, 2013.Smith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama Focus. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Focus was released on February 27, 2015. Smith was set to star in the Sci-Fic thriller Brilliance, an adaptation of Marcus Sakey&apos;s novel of the same name scripted by Jurassic Park writer David Koepp. But he left the project.Smith played Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute in the sports-drama Concussion, who became the first person to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a football player&apos;s brain. CTE is a degenerative disease caused by severe trauma to the head that can be discovered only after death. Smith&apos;s involvement is mostly due to his last-minute exit from the Sci-Fi thriller-drama Brilliance. Concussion was directed by Peter Landesman and-bead filmed in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. It received $14.4 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania. Principal photography started on October 27, 2014. Actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw played his wife. Omalu served as a consultant.As of November 2015, Smith is set to star in the independent drama Collateral Beauty, which will be directed by David Frankel.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Mira Katherine Sorvino was born on September 28, 1967 in Manhattan. She is the daughter of Lorraine Davis, an actress turned drama therapist, and veteran character actor Paul Sorvino. Her father&apos;s family were Italian immigrants. The young Sorvino was intelligent, an avid reader and an exceptional scholar. Her father discouraged her from becoming an actor, as he knew how the industry often chews up young stars. She attended Harvard, majoring in Chinese, graduating magna cum laude in 1989, largely on the strength of her thesis, a Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on racial conflict in China, written and researched during the year spent in Beijing, which helped her fluency in Mandarin Chinese.However, she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age, and moved to New York City to try her hand in the City&apos;s film industry, waitressing, auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s, but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Tra amici (1993), on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film, and, more importantly, was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received, and Sorvino&apos;s performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies, one a more prominent indie, Barcelona (1994), the other her first Hollywood feature, Quiz Show (1994), and her skillful performances brought her yet more attention.An exceptionally poised and articulate young woman, she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker, but Woody Allen took the chance, and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his La dea dell&apos;amore (1995) proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar (at the tender age of 29) for Best Supporting Actress. Since winning the Oscar, Sorvino has continued to take a wide range of roles, including another stretch as Marilyn Monroe in Norma Jean e Marilyn (1996), co-starring with another very intelligent and skilled young actress, Ashley Judd. Forays into action and horror, such as Mimic (1997) and Costretti ad uccidere (1998) show that Sorvino is not above being playful in the film roles she chooses.However, what forever cemented her role in popular culture was her performance as charmingly silly California beach girl Romy White in Romy &amp; Michelle (1997), in which she and co-star Lisa Kudrow utter one hilarious absurdity after another.Mira Sorvino married Christopher Backus on June 11, 2004, and the couple have four children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kevin Spacey Fowler, better known by his stage name Kevin Spacey, is an American actor of screen and stage, film director, producer, screenwriter and singer. He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999).His other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994), psychological thriller Seven (1995), the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997), the drama Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001)In Broadway theatre, Spacey won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. Since 2013, Spacey has played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. His work in House of Cards earned him Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor.As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey for years kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, &quot;the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person&quot;. In October 2017, he ended many years of media speculation about his personal life by confirming that he had enjoyed sexual relations with both men and women but now identified as homosexual.There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, in South Orange, New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister&apos;s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played &quot;Captain von Trapp&quot; opposite classmate Mare Winningham&apos;s &quot;Maria&quot; in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of &quot;Henry VI&quot;.Festival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the &quot;real world&quot; of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen&apos;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;. He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe&apos;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, Jack Lemmon, on a production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Long Day&apos;s Journey Into Night&quot;. While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as &quot;Uncle Louie&quot; in Neil Simon&apos;s Broadway hit &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;.Spacey&apos;s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in Heartburn - Affari di cuore (1986). Deemed more of a &quot;character actor&quot; than a &quot;leading man&quot;, he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain &quot;Mel Profitt&quot; on the TV series Oltre la legge - L&apos;informatore (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Americani (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in Il prezzo di Hollywood (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in I soliti sospetti (1995).The &quot;Suspects&quot; role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher&apos;s thriller Seven (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino&apos;s Riccardo III - Un uomo, un re (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Insoliti criminali (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in L.A. Confidential (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Mezzanotte nel giardino del bene e del male (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban comedy American Beauty (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences&apos; imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he&apos;s finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best, and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly.In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards - Gli intrighi del potere (2013). Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show&apos;s first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include Outstanding lead actor in a drama series. In 2017, he played a memorable role as a villain in the action thriller Baby Driver - Il genio della fuga (2017).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood&apos;s best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Lo squalo (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western Carovane verso il west (1957). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin&apos; (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin&apos; also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as E.T. - L&apos;extra-terrestre (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duel (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling&apos;s Mistero in galleria (1969), Marcus Welby (1969) and Colombo: Un giallo da manuale (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.Spielberg&apos;s first major directorial effort was Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: Lo squalo (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Incontri ravvicinati del terzo tipo (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable 1964: Allarme a N.Y. arrivano i Beatles! (1978), and followed that effort with La fantastica sfida (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell\\Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with I predatori dell&apos;arca perduta (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was Poltergeist - Demoniache presenze (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T. - L&apos;extra-terrestre (1982). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reese&apos;s Pieces in &quot;E.T.&quot; Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up &quot;Raiders&quot; with Indiana Jones e il tempio maledetto (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as I Goonies (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Gremlins (1984). He also produced the cartoon Fievel sbarca in America (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster Ritorno al futuro (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book Il colore viola (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed L&apos;impero del sole (1987), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.The late 1980s found Spielberg&apos;s projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Chi ha incastrato Roger Rabbit (1988). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Always - Per sempre (1989) as well as Indiana Jones e l&apos;ultima crociata (1989), and Ritorno al futuro - Parte II (1989). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad - PapÃ  (1989), with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, he produced the animated series I favolosi Tiny (1990), Animaniacs (1993), Mignolo e Prof (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain (1998), Qua la zampa, Doggie (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as Alla ricerca della valle incantata (1988), We&apos;re Back! - Quattro dinosauri a New York (1993), Casper (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of I Flintstones (1994), where he was credited as &quot;Steven Spielrock&quot;. Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Hook - Capitan Uncino (1991) and produced such films as the cute fantasy Joe contro il vulcano (1990) and Fievel conquista il West (1991). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller Aracnofobia (1990), Ritorno al futuro - Parte III (1990) and Gremlins 2 - La nuova stirpe (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Jurassic Park (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed Schindler&apos;s List (1993), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as La maschera di Zorro (1998), Men in Black (1997) and Deep Impact (1998). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Amistad (1997), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: Salvate il soldato Ryan (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare in Love (1998).Spielberg produced a series of films, including Evolution (2001), Haunting - Presenze (1999) and Shrek (2001). he also produced two sequels to Jurassic Park (1993), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: Band of Brothers - Fratelli al fronte (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director&apos;s chair for A.I. - Intelligenza artificiale (2001), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series SeaQuest (1993), an anthology series entitled Storie incredibili (1985), created the video-game series &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994). Spielberg, if you haven&apos;t noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called A Holocaust szemei (2000). With all of this to Spielberg&apos;s credit, it&apos;s no wonder that he&apos;s looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1946-07-06</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This athletically built, dark-haired American actor/screenwriter/director may never be mentioned by old-school film critics in the same breath as, say, Richard Burton or Alec Guinness; however, movie fans worldwide have been flocking to see Stallone&apos;s films for over 30 years, making &quot;Sly&quot; one of Hollywood&apos;s biggest-ever box office draws.Sylvester Stallone was born on July 6, 1946, in New York&apos;s gritty Hell&apos;s Kitchen, to Jackie Stallone (nÃ©e Labofish), an astrologer, and Frank Stallone, a beautician and hairdresser. His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother&apos;s heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The young Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and the University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he struggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core Italian Stallion - Porno proibito (1970), the thriller Una squillo per l&apos;ispettore Klute (1971) and the comedy Il dittatore dello stato libero di Bananas (1971). He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor Henry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film Happy Days - La banda dei fiori di pesco (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named &quot;Machine Gun Joe Viterbo&quot; in the Roger Corman-produced Anno 2000 - La corsa della morte (1975). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the &quot;million to one opportunity&quot; to challenge for the heavyweight title. Rocky (1976) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie series in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young, and director John G. Avildsen gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood&apos;s hottest new star.Stallone followed Rocky (1976) with F.I.S.T. (1978), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss &quot;Jimmy Hoffa&quot;, and Taverna paradiso (1978) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel Rocky II (1979). The second outing for the &quot;Italian Stallion&quot; wasn&apos;t as powerful or successful as the first &quot;Rocky&quot;, however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films I falchi della notte (1981) and Fuga per la vittoria (1981) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with Rocky III (1982) and a fearsome opponent in &quot;Clubber Lang&quot; played by muscular ex-bodyguard Mr. T. The third &quot;Rocky&quot; installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another series was about to commence for the busy actor.The character of Green Beret &quot;John Rambo&quot; was the creation of Canadian-born writer David Morrell, and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in Rambo (1982), also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public&apos;s psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with Rambo 2 - La vendetta (1985), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film&apos;s plotline about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and &quot;John Rambo&apos;s&quot; second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named &quot;Ivan Drago&quot; played by curt Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV (1985). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with &quot;Rocky&quot; fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous &quot;Rocky&quot; films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, at the hands of the unstoppable &quot;Siberian Express&quot;.Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. Cobra (1986) was a clumsy mess, Over the Top (1987) was equally mediocre, Rambo III (1988) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film Tango &amp; Cash (1989) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star Kurt Russell.Philadelphia&apos;s favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in Rocky V (1990) tackling Tommy &quot;Machine&quot; Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter Tommy Morrison, the great-nephew of screen legend John Wayne. Sly quickly followed with the lukewarm comedy Oscar - Un fidanzato per due figlie (1991), the painfully unfunny Fermati, o mamma spara (1992), the futuristic action film Demolition Man (1993), and the comic book-inspired Dredd - La legge sono io (1995). Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing Cop Land (1997), also starring Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. It isn&apos;t a classic of the genre, but Cop Land (1997) certainly surprised many critics with Stallone&apos;s understated performance. Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story Z la formica (1998), reprised the role made famous by Michael Caine in a terrible remake of La vendetta di Carter (2000), climbed back into a race car for Driven (2001), and guest-starred as the &quot;Toymaker&quot; in the third chapter of the immensely popular &quot;Spy Kids&quot; film series, Spy Kids - Missione 3-D: Game Over (2003). Showing that age had not wearied his two most popular series, Stallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky Balboa to star in, well, what else but Rocky Balboa (2006), and Vietnam veteran John Rambo (2008) will reappear after a 20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.Love him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and highly respected career in Hollywood, plus, he has considerably influenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film characters.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Oliver Stone has become known as a master of controversial subjects and a legendary film maker. His films are filled with a variety of film angles and styles, he pushes his actors to give Oscar-worthy performances, and despite his failures, has always returned to success.William Oliver Stone was born in New York City, to Jacqueline (Goddet) and Louis Stone, a stockbroker. His American father was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Eastern Europe), and his mother, a war bride, was French (and Catholic). After dropping out of Yale University, he became a soldier in the Vietnam War. Serving in two different regiments (including 1rst Cavalry), he was introduced to The Doors, drugs, Jefferson Airplane, and other things that defined the sixties. For his actions in the war, he was awarded a Bronze Star for Gallantry and a Purple Heart. Returning from the war, Stone did not return to graduate from Yale. His first film was a student film entitled Last Year in Viet Nam (1971), followed by the gritty horror film La regina del male (1974) for which he also wrote the screenplay. The next seven years saw him direct two films: Mad Man of Martinique (1979) and La mano (1981), starring Michael Caine. He also wrote many screenplays for films such as Fuga di mezzanotte (1978), Conan il barbaro (1982), and Scarface (1983). Stone won his first Oscar for Fuga di mezzanotte (1978), but his fame was just beginning to show.1986 was the year that brought him much fame to the U.S.A. and the world. He directed the political film Salvador (1986) starring Oscar-nominated James Woods. However, his big hit was the Vietnam war film Platoon (1986) starring Charlie Sheen,Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, and Francesco Quinn. Berenger and Dafoe received Oscar nominations for their roles as the polar opposite sergeants who each influence the tour of duty of Chris Taylor (Sheen). Stone won his first Oscar for directing this film, which won Best Picture and was a hit at the box office. After Platoon (1986), Stone followed up with the critically acclaimed Wall Street (1987). The movie, starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas, focuses on the business world of tycoons and stock brokers. The film was well received and won an Oscar for Douglas&apos; portrayal of the villainous Gordon Gekko. Stone returned immediately the following year with Talk Radio (1988), which talked of a foul-mouthed radio host (played by Eric Bogosian) who never fails to talk about the serious issues. Although it was not as successful as his last three films, Stone did not slow down at all. He directed Tom Cruise into an Oscar-nominated role in Nato il quattro luglio (1989).The movie talked about the return of an embittered, crippled Vietnam soldier from the war. Although it failed to win Best Picture or Best Actor, Oliver Stone won an Academy Award for Directing, his third win to date. After Nato il quattro luglio (1989), Stone took a hand in producing several movies, including the Academy Award-winning film Il mistero Von Bulow (1990). He returned to the director&apos;s chair in 1991, once again with two films. Val Kilmer starred as the legendary and controversial Jim Morrison in Stone&apos;s psychedelic film The Doors (1991).Despised by former Doors member Ray Manzarek, the film is nevertheless a wonderful achievement, with Kilmer pulling off an almost flawless impersonation of Morrison. Regardless of opinion, The Doors (1991) was overshadowed by Stone&apos;s colossal film JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991), which Stone himself considers the best of his films. In Stone&apos;s movie, Jim Garrison tackles the conspiracy behind the murder of America&apos;s president John F. Kennedy. The large cast featured such well-known names as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, and Walter Matthau. This film represented a change in Stone&apos;s works, because it was with this film that he really began to explore the different camera styles and combining them together to create a multi-dimensional way of showing a movie. JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991), as with Platoon (1986) and Nato il quattro luglio (1989), earned eight Oscar nominations and was one of Stone&apos;s most successful films. However, he failed to win a third Oscar for Best Director.After this film, Stone directed his third Vietnam film to date. Tra cielo e terra (1993) was a film about the war from the viewpoint of a Vietnamese girl, and also co-starred Tommy Lee Jones (who had received an Oscar nomination for JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991)). Despite its new woman&apos;s perspective and several positive reviews, it was a box office failure. Stone was unfazed; his next film is perhaps his most notorious film to date. Adapting a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, Stone made Assassini nati - Natural Born Killers (1994) starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore and Rodney Dangerfield in his only dramatic performance. The film was received well at the box office, while review were very mixed. Because of the violence that people claimed was inspired by the film, it was compared to Stanley Kubrick&apos;s Arancia meccanica (1971). As usual, Stone was at the center of controversial subjects; his next film Gli intrighi del potere - Nixon (1995) was no exception. The film focused on the life of President Richard Nixon, played by Anthony Hopkins, while featuring another well-known cast, including Joan Allen in the role of Nixon&apos;s wife. Both went on to receive Oscar nominations, while Stone received his sixth Oscar nomination for Screenwriting. The film got mixed reviews, and failed to recoup its budget.Aside from directing, Stone has worked as a producer on several different films. There was, of course, the successful film Il mistero Von Bulow (1990), which won Jeremy Irons an Oscar and also nominated the director for an Oscar. There was also the highly praised and successful emotional drama Il circolo della fortuna e della felicitÃ  (1993) which centered around four Chinese immigrant women whose relationships with their daughters is affected by their own lives. Another highly praised Oscar nominated film was Milos Forman&apos;s classic film Larry Flynt - Oltre lo scandalo (1996) starring Woody Harrelson, Edward Norton, and Courtney Love. Whether the crime/action film The Corruptor - Indagine a Chinatown (1999) or the brilliant war epic Savior (1998), Stone has worked in a variety of film genres.Stone had directed ten films in nine years; now however, he began to slow down. He directed the film U Turn - Inversione di marcia (1997) starring Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez. As with Assassini nati - Natural Born Killers (1994), it was a dark and twisted satire on violence, but did not have the same success as the former. Stone was set to direct several projects in the late 90&apos;s but they fell through and were not made. However, success came back to Stone in the Al Pacino film Ogni maledetta domenica (1999). This sports movie centered on the life behind the game of football, and it starred an impressive cast that included frequent Stone collaborators James Woods and John C. McGinley. This film was one of his most successful box office films, and put him back on track.The following years brought Stone no new theatrical films, though he did make three fascinating TV documentaries. Two of them, &apos;Looking for Fidel&apos; and Comandante (2003) were interviews of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, while &apos;Persona Non Grata&apos; was an interview of several Palestinian leaders. Stone was also set to direct American Psycho (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Beyond Borders - Amore senza confini (2003), starring Angelina Jolie and at the time, Ralph Fiennes. However, Stone dropped out of both projects, as did a number of the actors mentioned. Finally, five years after Ogni maledetta domenica (1999), Stone directed a film he&apos;d long wanted to make; the colossal epic Alexander (2004). Starring Colin Farrell as the Macedonian leader, Stone attempted to capture the essence of Alexander the Great through his conquests of the known world. The film focused on Alexander&apos;s relationships with his parents (a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer and a less impressive one by Angelina Jolie) and his relationships with his wife and childhood friend/ gay lover (played by Rosario Dawson and Jared Leto respectively).Alexander (2004) was a critical failure, and failed to win back its budget domestically. Despite being one of 2004&apos;s highest grossing films internationally, and recouping its budget through DVD sales, Stone&apos;s pet project was heavily criticized. Despite a far superior version (Alexander Revisited) being released on DVD, the film&apos;s reputation remains low by the majority. Stone was personally stung at these attacks, but managed to rebound, if mildly, with his hopeful film World Trade Center (2006). The film centers on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin towers. It received good reviews, and allowed Oliver to step forward from his failure towards the possibility of more films.In late 2007, besides a number of projects Stone was set to direct &quot;Pinkville&quot;, which would have been his fourth Vietnam film to date. It was set to star a large number of well known actors such as Bruce Willis, Toby Jones, Channing Tatum, Michael Pitt, Woody Harrelson, and Michael PeÃ±a. However, a week before shooting was to begin, the Writer&apos;s Strike was started, and the finance for the film was cut, using the strike as an excuse. After Willis backed out of the project, it was eventually scuttled, much like Stone&apos;s early productions of Platoon (1986) and Nato il quattro luglio (1989). Stone turned to another project he had worked on with former Wall Street (1987) collaborator Stanley Weiser. The project was W. (2008), a biography on president George W. Bush. Stone initially cast Christian Bale in the role of Bush but the actor dropped out at the last minute. Josh Brolin was cast, and this followed with a large cast of well known Oscar nominated character actors such as Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell, and Ellen Burstyn. The film was made in a record four months, starting in June and released in October. The film opened to mixed reviews, and though film&apos;s budget was recouped, it was not a financial hit.Stone then made the documentary Chavez - L&apos;ultimo comandante (2009), a documentary which focused on bringing to light the positive aspects of the left-wing governments in South America, particularly Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Stone was much less critical than usual, instead making the documentary as a response to the harsh reputation that Chavez has in the States. The documentary was poorly received in the States. Stone also began work on Wall Street - Il denaro non dorme mai (2010). Starring Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, and Eli Wallach, the film focuses on the 2008 economic crisis, and the return of Gordon Gekko from prison. The film was screened at Cannes to positive reception, and hailed as Stone&apos;s triumphant return. After this, Stone made a film adaptation of &quot;Savages&quot;, a novel by Don Winslow . The movie follows two highly successful marijuana growers (Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson ), whose shared girlfriend (Blake Lively) is kidnapped by a Mexican cartel and held for ransom. The movie also starred Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro, John Travolta, and Emile Hirsch. The film was a return to the tense action and violence of Stone&apos;s earlier films, though it polarized many audience members due to the colorful narrations of Lively&apos;s vapid and naive character, as well as the film&apos;s ending.After completing the ambitious and well-received television project Oliver Stone - USA, la storia mai raccontata (2012), as well as a documentary on Hugo Chavez, Stone finally returned to feature films with Snowden (2016). Based on the life of American whistle blower Edward Snowden, Stone&apos;s film depicted his awakening to the truth behind the massive surveillances conducted by the NSA, and his attempt to warn the general public of what they did not know. The film was done independently, financed by Europeans on a low budget. It was also a return to form for Stone in a way that had not been seen since &quot;Alexander&quot;. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, delivered a very strong performance as Snowden, with the supporting cast including Shailene Woodley, Rhys Ifans, Melissa Leo, Timothy Olyphant, and Nicolas Cage. Sadly, the film received a mixed response from critics, and was a box office disappointment.Since then, Stone has returned to television for his next two projects. One is a series of interviews with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and the other is directing a new fictional series based on the abusive Guantanamo prison. It will be his first venture into fictional television.Oliver Stone is a three-time Oscar winner, and although he has mostly been stung by critics of his films, he remains a well-known name today in the film industry. The films he directed have been nominated for 31 Academy Awards, including eight for acting, six for screen writing, and three for directing. There is no denying that Stone has cemented himself a position among the legends of Hollywood.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sharon Stone was born and raised in Meadville, a small town in Pennsylvania. Her strict father was a factory worker, and her mother was a homemaker. She was the second of four children. At the age of 15, she studied in Saegertown High School, Pennsylvania, and at that same age, entered Edinboro State University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with a degree in creative writing and fine arts. She was a very smart girl (with an IQ of 154), became a bookworm, and once was told that a suitable job for her (and her brains) was to become a lawyer. However, her first love was still the black-and-white movies, especially those featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. So, the 17-year-old Sharon got herself into the Miss Crawford County and won the beauty contest.From working part-time as a McDonald&apos;s counter girl, she worked her way up to become a successful Ford model, both in TV commercials and print ads. In 1980, she made her acting debut in Woody Allen&apos;s Stardust Memories (1980) as &quot;pretty girl in train&quot;. Her first speaking part, though, was in Wes Craven&apos;s horror movie, Benedizione mortale (1981). She struggled through many parts in B-movies, notably Allan Quatermain e le miniere di re Salomone (1985) and Action Jackson (1988). She was also married in 1984 to Michael Greenburg, the producer of MacGyver (1985), but they divorced two years later.She finally got her big break with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Atto di forza (1990) and also posed nude for Playboy, a daring move for a 32-year-old actress. But it worked; she landed the breakthrough role as a sociopath novelist, &quot;Catherine Tramell&quot;, in Basic Instinct (1992). Her interrogation scene has become a classic in film history and her performance captivated everyone, from MTV viewers, who honored her with Most Desirable Female and Best Female Performance Awards, to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. After she got famous, she didn&apos;t want to be typecast, so she played a victim in Sliver (1993), and, in Trappola d&apos;amore (1994), she was the aloof, estranged wife of Richard Gere. These movies didn&apos;t &quot;work,&quot; so she got herself again into more aggressive roles , such as Lo specialista (1994) with Sylvester Stallone and Pronti a morire (1995) with Gene Hackman.But it wasn&apos;t until she played a beautiful but drug-crazy wife of Robert De Niro in CasinÃ² (1995) that she got far more than just fame and fortune--she also received the acknowledgment of the movie industry for her acting ability. She received her first Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. She did a couple of films afterwards, teaming up with Isabelle Adjani in Diabolique (1996), and as a woman waiting for her death penalty in Difesa ad oltranza (1996). In 1998, she married a newspaper editor,Phil Bronstein but they divorced later in 2004. She received her third Golden Globe nomination for Basta guardare il cielo (1998), a film that her company, &quot;Chaos&quot;, also co-executive produced. The next year, she played the title role in Gloria (1999) and entered her first comedic role in La dea del successo (1999), which gave her another Golden Globe nomination.Sharon Stone, a diva who thoroughly enjoys her hard-won stardom, is now a mother of three children: Roan, Laird and Quinn.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. His father, Tony Tarantino, is an Italian-American actor and musician from New York, and his mother, Connie (McHugh), is a nurse from Tennessee. Quentin moved with his mother to Torrance, California, when he was four years old.In January of 1992, first-time writer-director Tarantino&apos;s Le iene (1992) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with Pulp Fiction (1994) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D&apos;Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner Roger Avary came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology Four Rooms (1995) with friends and fellow auteurs Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Allison Anders. The film opened December 25 in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino&apos;s next film was Dal tramonto all&apos;alba (1996), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with George Clooney. The film did fairly well theatrically.Since then, Tarantino has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill - Volume 1 (2003), Kill Bill - Volume 2 (2004), Bastardi senza gloria (2009), Django Unchained (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Charlize Theron was born in Benoni, a city in the greater Johannesburg area, in South Africa, the only child of Gerda Theron (nÃ©e Maritz) and Charles Theron. She was raised on a farm outside the city. Theron is of Afrikaner (Dutch, with some French Huguenot and German) descent, and Afrikaner military figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle.Theron received an education as a ballet dancer and has danced both the &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. There was not much work for a young actress or dancer in South Africa, so she soon traveled to Europe and the United States, where she got a job at the Joffrey Ballet in New York. She was also able to work as a photo model. However, an injured knee put a halt to her dancing career.In 1994, her mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood Boulevard, but without any luck. She went to a bank to cash a check for $500 she received from her mother, and became furious when she learned that the bank would not cash it because it was an out-of-state check. She made a scene and an agent gave her his card, in exchange for learning American English, which she did by watching soap operas on television.Her first role was in the B-film Grano rosso sangue III: Urban Harvest (1995), a non-speaking part with three seconds of screen time. Her next role was as Helga Svelgen in Due giorni senza respiro (1996), which landed her the role of Tina Powers in Music Graffiti (1996). Since then, she has starred in movies like L&apos;avvocato del diavolo (1997), Il grande Joe (1998), Le regole della casa del sidro (1999), La leggenda di Bagger Vance (2000) and The Italian Job (2003). On February 29, 2004, she won her first Academy Award, a Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Monster (2003).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Uma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly unorthodox and internationally-minded family. She is the daughter of Nena Thurman (nÃ©e Birgitte Caroline von SchlebrÃ¼gge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain retreat, and of Robert Thurman (Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and academic who is one of the nation&apos;s foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma&apos;s mother was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who herself was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma&apos;s father, a New Yorker, has English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry. Uma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at Amherst College.Thurman&apos;s household was one in which the The Dalai Lama was an occasional guest; she and her siblings all have names deriving from Buddhist mythology; and Middle American behavior was little understood, much less pursued. And so it was that the young Thurman confronted childhood with an odd name and eccentric home life -- and nature seemingly conspired against her as well. She is six feet tall, and from an early age towered over everyone else in class. Her famously large feet would soon sprout to size 11 -- and even beyond that -- and although they would eventually be lovingly filmed by director Quentin Tarantino, as a child she generally wore the biggest shoes in class, which only provided another subject of ridicule. Even her long nose moved one of her mother&apos;s friends to helpfully suggest rhinoplasty -- to the ten-year-old Thurman. To make matters worse yet, the family constantly relocated, making the gangly, socially inept Thurman perpetually the new kid in class. The result was an exceptionally awkward, self-conscious, lonely and alienated childhood.Unsurprisingly, the young Thurman enjoyed making believe she was someone other than herself, and so thrived at acting in school plays -- her sole successful extracurricular activity. This interest, and her lanky frame, perfect for modeling, led the 15-year-old Thurman to New York City for high school and modeling work (including a layout in Glamour Magazine) as she sought acting roles. The roles soon came, starting with a few formulaic and forgettable Hollywood products, but immediately followed by Terry Gilliam&apos;s Le avventure del Barone di Munchausen (1988) and Stephen Frears&apos; Le relazioni pericolose (1988), both of which brought much attention to her unorthodox sensuality and performances that intriguingly combined innocence and worldliness. The weird, gangly girl became a sex symbol virtually overnight.Thurman continued to be offered good roles in Hollywood pictures into the early &apos;90s, the least commercially successful but probably best-known of which was her smoldering, astonishingly-adult performance as June, Henry Miller&apos;s wife, in Henry &amp; June (1990), the first movie to actually receive the dreaded NC-17 rating in the USA. After a celebrated start, Thurman&apos;s career stalled in the early &apos;90s with movies such as the mediocre Lo sbirro, il boss e la bionda (1993). Worse, her first starring role was in Cowgirl - Il nuovo sesso (1993), which had endured a tortured journey from cult-favorite book to big-budget movie, and was a critical and financial debacle. Fortunately, Uma bounced back with a brilliant performance as Mia Wallace, that most unorthodox of all gangster&apos;s molls, in Tarantino&apos;s lauded, hugely successful Pulp Fiction (1994), a role for which Thurman received an Academy Award nomination.Since then, Thurman has had periods of flirting with roles in arty independents such as Un mese al lago (1995), and supporting roles in which she has lent some glamorous presence to a mixed batch of movies, such as Beautiful Girls (1996) and Un uomo in prestito (1996). Thurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison Ivy in the reviled Joel Schumacher effort Batman &amp; Robin (1997) and Emma Peel in a remake of The Avengers - Agenti speciali (1998). She worked with Woody Allen and Sean Penn on Accordi &amp; disaccordi (1999), and starred in Richard Linklater&apos;s drama Tape (2001) opposite Hawke. Thurman also won a Golden Globe award for her turn in the made-for-television film Gli occhi della vita (2002), directed by Mira Nair.A return to the mainstream spotlight came when Thurman re-teamed with Quentin Tarantino for Kill Bill - Volume 1 (2003), a revenge flick the two had dreamed up on the set of Pulp Fiction (1994). She also turned up in the John Woo cautioner Paycheck (2003) that same year. The renewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was dealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this time. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her surging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her work in Kill Bill - Volume 2 (2004) and was hailed as Tarantino&apos;s muse. Thurman reunited with Pulp Fiction (1994) dance partner John Travolta for the Get Shorty (1995) sequel Be Cool (2005) and played Ulla in The Producers - Una gaia commedia neonazista (2005).Thurman had been briefly married to Gary Oldman, from 1990 to 1992. In 1998, she married Ethan Hawke, her co-star in the offbeat futuristic thriller Gattaca - La porta dell&apos;universo (1997). The couple had two children, Levon and Maya. Hawke and Thurman filed for divorce in 2004.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An actress who always attracts audiences&apos; attention, Jennifer Tilly is by turns funny, sexy, compassionate, compelling and often all at once. She burst onto the scene playing the tone deaf Monica Moran in I favolosi Baker (1989), opposite brothers Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges. She has been playing unforgettable characters ever since. She earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the hopelessly untalented Olive Neal in Woody Allen&apos;s Pallottole su Broadway (1994). She followed that up with a memorable turn as Jim Carrey&apos;s gold-digging client in the blockbuster Bugiardo bugiardo (1997). A sultry performance as Violet, opposite Gina Gershon, helped make Lana Wachowski&apos;s and Lilly Wachowski&apos;s Bound - Torbido inganno (1996) a breakout indie success at the Sundance Film Festival and then in theatres. It also expanded Jennifer&apos;s already significant gay and lesbian following.Jennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Ellen Chan in Harbor City, Los Angeles, to Harry Chan, a used car salesman, who was of Chinese origin, and Patricia (nÃ©e Tilly), a schoolteacher and stage actress. Her sister is actress Meg Tilly. They were raised on rural Texada Island, British Columbia, by her mother and stepfather, John Ward.Over the years, Jennifer has worked with some of the world&apos;s best directors, including Terry Gilliam (Tideland - Il mondo capovolto (2005)), Neil Jordan (High Spirits - Fantasmi da legare (1988)), Joe Pytka (Felice e vincente (1989)), Roger Donaldson (Getaway (1994)), Ronny Yu (La sposa di Chucky (1998)), Woody Allen (Pallottole su Broadway (1994)), Jerry Shatzberg (Una cotta importante (1984)), Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little - Un topolino in gamba (1999) and La casa dei fantasmi (2003)), Peter Bogdanovich (Hollywood Confidential (2001)), in which she played Louella Parsons, Richard Benjamin (Made in America (1993)), Alphonso Arau (The Magnificent Ambersons (2002)), Oliver Stone (The Doors (1991)), Albert Brooks (La dea del successo (1999)) and Michael Radford (Dancing at the Blue Iguana (2000)). Other films include: Saint Ralph (2004), Musica da un&apos;altra stanza (1998), L&apos;ombra del lupo (1992), Bart Got a Room (2008), An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong (2009), P.J. Castellaneta&apos;s Relax... It&apos;s Just Sex (1998), Un tipo sbagliato (1997), Second Best (2004), Sister Mary Explains It All (2001), La bella Mafia (1997), Edie &amp; Pen (1996), I soliti amici (2000), and many more. Jennifer has appeared on some of television&apos;s best series, including Cin cin (1982), Mai dire sÃ¬ (1982), Moonlighting (1985), CSI - Scena del crimine (2000) and Frasier (1993). She was a recurring character on Hill Street giorno e notte (1981), It&apos;s Garry Shandling&apos;s Show. (1986) and Out of Practice - Medici senza speranza (2005), and a series regular on NBC&apos;s Shaping Up (1984) and Fox&apos;s Key West (1993). She is also in great demand as a voice-over artist. Her vocal characterizations include the snaky-haired Celia in Pixel&apos;s Monsters &amp; Co. (2001), the new age cow Grace in Disney&apos;s Mucche alla riscossa (2004), and the perpetually pregnant Bonnie Swanson on I Griffin (1999). Equally at home on stage as well as film, she has many theatre credits under her belt. She received a Theatre World Award for her performance in Second Stage&apos;s &quot;One Shoe Off&quot; performed at the Joseph Papp.Jennifer successfully cultivated another fan base with the revitalization of the &quot;Child&apos;s Play&quot; horror comedy franchise. For Ronny Yu&apos;s La sposa di Chucky (1998), the filmmakers turned to Jennifer to create the character who would spark the series in a new direction. She met the challenge and established a new horror icon in Tiffany. In Rogue Pictures&apos; Il figlio di Chucky (2004), written and directed by series creator Don Mancini, Jennifer again took the popular series to the next level; starring as Tiffany and as herself, the deadly doll&apos;s favorite actress, who soon becomes an unwitting hostess in more ways than one.Jennifer&apos;s pitch-perfect voiceover work as Tiffany is not the only instance of her being able to incarnate a character from the vocal chords out. Families know her distinctive cadences from the Disney hits Mucche alla riscossa (2004), directed by Will Finn and John Sanford; La casa dei fantasmi (2003) (in which Jennifer acted from the neck up only), directed by Rob Minkoff; and the Pixar blockbuster Monsters &amp; Co. (2001) (voicing Mike&apos;s love interest Celia), directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman and Lee Unkrich. She began her acting career as a teenager, putting herself through the theater program at Stephens College in Missouri by winning writing competitions. She then headed to Los Angeles, California. While she continued to act on the stage (earning a Dramalogue Award for her performance in &quot;Vanities&quot;), movies and television immediately came calling for the actress with the unique voice and visage.In 2001, she starred in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Women&quot; with Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Johnson, which was later taped for, and broadcast on, PBS. In 2008, she appeared with Miranda Richardson in the critically acclaimed production of Wallace Shawn&apos;s play &quot;Grasses of a Thousand Colors&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in London. Other plays include &quot;Tartuffe&quot; (LAAT) &quot;Boy&apos;s Life&quot; (LAAT) &quot;Baby with the Bathwater&quot; (LAPT) and others too numerous to mention. In 2005, Jennifer met her boyfriend, professional poker player Phil Laak (also known as the Unabomber). That summer at the World Series of Poker, she bested a field of 601 to take down the Ladies Event and win a coveted gold bracelet. She followed this up by winning the WPT Ladies Invitational, making her one of a small but elite group holding both a WSOP bracelet, and a WPT title. In summer 2010, she also won the Bellagio Cup 5k tournament.She writes a monthly column for Bluff magazine, and is a regular on the tournament circuit. Jennifer is a familiar face on many poker television shows, including &quot;Poker Superstars&quot;, &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;, &quot;The Big Game&quot;, &quot;The World Poker Open&quot;, &quot;The Poker Lounge&quot; and NBC&apos;s &quot;Heads Up&quot;, to name a few. She is number 25 on the Women&apos;s All Time Money list, with career earnings in excess of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Upcoming films include 30 Beats (2012) with Justin Kirk and Paz de la Huerta, and The Secret Lives of Dorks (2013) starring opposite Jim Belushi. In December 2010, she received the Best Actress Award from the WIFT (Women in Film and Television) Foundation for her work in the Mary McGuckian films Intervention (2007) and Inconceivable (2008) slated for release in 2011.In addition, she has been a favored guest on a number of talk shows, from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) to The Arsenio Hall Show (1989) to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992). Those interview segments have encouraged viewers to expect the unexpected from her interplay with the host and the studio audience.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Joseph Travolta was born in Englewood, New Jersey, one of six children of Helen Travolta (nÃ©e Helen Cecilia Burke) and Salvatore/Samuel J. Travolta. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. His father owned a tire repair shop called Travolta Tires in Hillsdale, NJ. Travolta started acting appearing in a local production of &quot;Who&apos;ll Save the Plowboy?&quot;. His mother, herself an actress and dancer, enrolled him in a drama school in New York, where he studied voice, dancing and acting. He decided to combine all three of these skills and become a musical comedy performer. At 16 he landed his first professional job in a summer stock production of the musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. He quit school at 16 and moved to New York, and worked regularly in summer stock and on television commercials. When work became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in minor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company of the hit 1950s musical &quot;Grease&quot; brought him back to New York. An opening in the New York production of &quot;Grease&quot; gave him his first Broadway role at age 18. After &quot;Grease&quot;, he became a member of the company of the Broadway show &quot;Over Here&quot;, which starred The Andrews Sisters. After ten months in &quot;Over Here&quot;, he decided to try Hollywood once again. Once back in Hollywood, he had little trouble getting roles in numerous television shows. He was seen on A Tutte le auto della polizia (1972), Squadra emergenza (1972) and Medical Center (1969) and also made a movie, Il maligno (1975), which was shot in New Mexico.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Liv Tyler is an actress of international renown and has been a familiar face on our screens for over two decades and counting. She began modelling at the age of fourteen before pursuing a career in acting. After making her film debut in Bruce Beresford&apos;s Silent Fall, she was cast by fledgling director James Mangold (who would go on to direct such hits as Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line and Logan) in his first feature Heavy, a critical and commercial success that went on to gain cult status. This was followed by another indie cult hit, Empire Records, but it was the leading role in Bernardo Bertolucci&apos;s Stealing Beauty that catapulted her to stardom at the age of eighteen.Liv was next seen in Tom Hanks&apos; hugely successful passion project That Thing You Do!, his paean to the glory days of 1960s rock &apos;n&apos; roll (as the child of a rock &apos;n&apos; roll background, this was a film whose subject was also dear to Liv&apos;s heart). This was followed by Michael Bay&apos;s action blockbuster Armageddon, starring alongside Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi, who would later go on to direct Liv in Lonesome Jim.Liv had come to the attention of director Robert Altman in Stealing Beauty and the late, great auteur went on to cast her in two of his final projects, Cookie&apos;s Fortune and Dr T and the Women, describing her as &quot;very serious, very prepared and very professional...I am crazy about her.&quot;In between her work for Altman, Liv starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in Onegin, directed by his sister Martha, from the classic novel by Alexander Pushkin. Ralph Fiennes said of Liv, &quot;We tested a lot of actresses but Liv has an acute sense of emotional truth that&apos;s not performed or projected, but just is.&quot;In 2001, Liv portrayed Arwen in the ground-breaking epic The Lord of the Rings trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King.Nothing if not eclectic, Liv then defied expectations by starring in cult director Kevin Smith&apos;s gentle low-budget comedy Jersey Girl, re-uniting her with her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck, before playing Betty, the female lead to Edward Norton&apos;s Bruce Banner in Marvel&apos;s The Incredible Hulk.An actress who consistently refuses to be pigeonholed, Liv&apos;s career is one that cuts across genres; she cannot be defined by the roles she has chosen and is led, above all, by what speaks to her on an instinctual and emotional level. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult to say no to whatever comes along,&quot; Tom Hanks has said of her, &quot;...But she&apos;s saying no to all the right things.&quot;In addition to her acting work, Liv has forged a decade-long relationship with Givenchy as the spokesperson for their fragrance and cosmetics line. Liv is also a brand ambassador for Triumph lingerie, developing a capsule collection that celebrates the company&apos;s commitment to body confidence, as exemplified by Liv herself, &quot;a modern woman in every sense, a mother and actress with a fierce sense of femininity that women across the world can relate to.&quot;Liv&apos;s previous design collaboration was with Belstaff, resulting in two capsule collections for the iconic British heritage brand. Liv has also been the face of commercial campaigns for several global brands, including Visa and Pantene.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille FranÃ§ois Van Varenberg in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, to Eliana and EugÃ¨ne Van Varenberg, an accountant. &quot;The Muscles from Brussels&quot; started martial arts at the age of eleven. His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, Van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association&apos;s middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels. In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career.Over the next 6-years, he competed in both full-contact and semi-contact matches. He debuted under his birth name of Jean Claude Van Varenberg. In his first match, Jean-Claude was staggered by a round-house kick thrown by fellow countryman, Toon Van Oostrum in Brussels, Belgium. Van Damme was badly stunned, but came back to knockout Van Oostrum moments later. In 1977, at the WAKO Open International in Antwerp, Belgium, Jean-Claude lost a decision to fellow team mate Patrick Teugels in a semi-contact match. At the 1978 Challenge De Espoirs Karate Tournament (1st Trials),Jean-Claude placed 2nd in the semi-contact division. He defeated twenty-five opponents during the week long tournament, but lost in the finals to Angelo Spataro from the Naha Club. Later in 1978, Jean-Claude lost a 3-round match for the Belgium Lightweight Championship (semi-contact) to his fellow team-mate to Patrick Teugels.In 1979, Jean-Claude traveled to the United States of America, to Tampa, Florida. In his first and only match against a United States opponent, Van Damme faced &apos;Sherman &apos;Big Train&apos;Bergman&apos;, a kick-boxer from Miami Beach, Florida. For the first and only time in his career, Jean-Claude was knocked to the canvas after absorbing a powerful left hook from Bergman. However, Jean-Claude climbed off the canvas and with a perfectly timed ax-kick, knocked Bergman out in 56 seconds of the first round. Jean-Claude was a member of the Belgium team which competed on December 26, 1979 at the La Coupe Fancois Persoons Karate Tournament which was sanctioned by the Federation bruxelloise de Karate. Van Damme&apos;s final match victory enabled his team to win the European Team Karate Championship. In Full-Contact karate, Jean-Claude knocked out England&apos;s Micheal Heming in 46 seconds of the first round. In 1980, Van Damme knocked out France&apos;s Georges Verlugels in 2 rounds of a match fought under kick-boxing rules. Jean-Claude wanted to defeat his rival Patrick Teugels. At the Forest Nationals in Brussels, on March 8, 1980, Jean-Claude knocked Teugels down and Teugels suffered a nose injury and was unable to continue. Jean-Claude was awarded a first round victory.Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of 41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981 Van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie Rombo di tuono (1984), but it wasn&apos;t good enough to get anybody&apos;s attention. Then in 1984 he got a role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie Vendetta personale (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Senza esclusione di colpi (1988). But the movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme did not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the U.S. Shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a U.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.His martial arts assets, highlighted by his ability to deliver a kick to an opponent&apos;s head during a leaping 360-degree turn, and his good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), Lionheart - Scommessa vincente (1990), Double Impact - La vendetta finale (1991) and I nuovi eroi (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop - Indagine dal futuro (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office - La prova (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team - Gioco di squadra (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife Gladys Portugues and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his problems and made movies like The Replicant (2001), Derailed - Punto d&apos;impatto (2002), and Hell - Esplode la furia (2003) which did averagely in box office terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in those movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in different action tones.</rdfs:comment>

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in The Fighter (2010), Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in Ted (2012).Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse&apos;s aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn&apos;t have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark&apos;s mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son&apos;s subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He&apos;d spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time, his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band New Kids on the Block. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his &quot;Funky Bunch&quot; and &quot;Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch&quot; was born. His debut album, &quot;Music for the People&quot;, was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper&apos;s willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping &quot;bad boy&quot;. Record producer David Geffen saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer Calvin Klein, Marky Mark was set up as the designer&apos;s chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the New Kids on the Block&apos;s fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, &quot;Marky Mark&apos;s&quot; bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with Madonna and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper Shabba Ranks, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot;, had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the &quot;Marky Mark&quot; moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in Penny Marshall&apos;s Mezzo professore tra i marines (1994). Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In Mezzo professore tra i marines (1994), he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial Ritorno dal nulla (1995) and chilled them in Paura (1996) as every father&apos;s worst nightmare.The major turning point in Wahlberg&apos;s career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s Boogie Nights - L&apos;altra Hollywood (1997). Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as Three Kings (1999) and La tempesta perfetta (2000), popcorn flicks like Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001) and Contraband (2012), and even indies such as I Heart Huckabees - Le strane coincidenze della vita (2004).Wahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as Boardwalk Empire: L&apos;impero del crimine (2010), In Treatment (2008) and the highly successful comedy Entourage (2004), which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham have four children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr. was born on December 28, 1954 in Mount Vernon, New York. He is the middle of three children of a beautician mother, Lennis, from Georgia, and a Pentecostal minister father, Denzel Washington, Sr., from Virginia. After graduating from high school, Denzel enrolled at Fordham University, intent on a career in journalism. However, he caught the acting bug while appearing in student drama productions and, upon graduation, he moved to San Francisco and enrolled at the American Conservatory Theater. He left A.C.T. after only one year to seek work as an actor. His first paid acting role was in a summer stock theater stage production in St. Mary&apos;s City, Maryland. The play was &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot;, which is about the founding of the colony of Maryland (now the state of Maryland) and the early days of the Maryland colonial assembly (a legislative body). He played the part of a real historical character, Mathias Da Sousa, although much of the dialogue was created. Afterwards he began to pursue screen roles in earnest. With his acting versatility and powerful presence, he had no difficulty finding work in numerous television productions.He made his first big screen appearance in Il pollo si mangia con le mani (1981) with George Segal. Through the 1980s, he worked in both movies and television and was chosen for the plum role of Dr. Philip Chandler in NBC&apos;s hit medical series A cuore aperto (1982), a role that he would play for six years. In 1989, his film career began to take precedence when he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Tripp, the runaway slave in Edward Zwick&apos;s powerful historical masterpiece Glory - Uomini di gloria (1989).Washington has received much critical acclaim for his film work since the 1990s, including his portrayals of real-life figures such as South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko in Grido di libertÃ  (1987), Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X in Malcolm X (1992), boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter in Hurricane - Il grido dell&apos;innocenza (1999), football coach Herman Boone in Il sapore della vittoria - Uniti si vince (2000), poet and educator Melvin B. Tolson in The Great Debaters - Il potere della parola (2007), and drug kingpin Frank Lucas in American Gangster (2007). Malcolm X and The Hurricane garnered him Oscar nominations for Best Actor, before he finally won that statuette in 2002 for his lead role in Training Day (2001).Through the 1990s, Denzel also co-starred in such big budget productions as Il rapporto Pelican (1993), Philadelphia (1993), Allarme rosso (1995), Uno sguardo dal cielo (1996), and Il coraggio della veritÃ  (1996), a role for which he was paid $10 million. He continued to define his onscreen persona as the tough, no-nonsense hero through the 2000s in films like Out of Time (2003), Man on Fire - Il fuoco della vendetta (2004), Inside Man (2006), and Pelham 1 2 3 - Ostaggi in metropolitana (2009). Cerebral and meticulous in his film work, he made his debut as a director with Antwone Fisher (2002); he also directed The Great Debaters - Il potere della parola (2007) and Barriere (2016).In 2010, Washington headlined Codice Genesi (2010), a post-Apocalyptic drama. Later that year, he starred as a veteran railroad engineer in the action film Unstoppable - Fuori controllo (2010), about an unmanned, half-mile-long runaway freight train carrying dangerous cargo. The film was his fifth and final collaboration with director Tony Scott, following Allarme rosso (1995), Man on Fire - Il fuoco della vendetta (2004), DÃ©jÃ  Vu (2006) and The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. He has also been a featured actor in the films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and has been a frequent collaborator of director Spike Lee.In 2012, Washington starred in Flight (2012), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He co-starred with Ryan Reynolds in Safe House - Nessuno Ã¨ al sicuro (2012), and prepared for his role by subjecting himself to a torture session that included waterboarding. In 2013, Washington starred in Cani sciolti (2013), alongside Mark Ryan Walberg. In 2014, he starred in The Equalizer - Il vendicatore (2014), an action thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Richard Wenk, based on the television series of same name starring Edward Woodward. During this time period, he also took on the role of producer for some of his films, including The Book of Eli and Safe House.In 2016, he was selected as the recipient for the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.He lives in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Pauletta Washington, and their four children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sigourney Weaver was born Susan Alexandra Weaver in Leroy Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. Her father, TV producer Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., originally wanted to name her Flavia, because of his passion for Roman history (he had already named her elder brother Trajan). Her mother, Elizabeth Inglis (nÃ©e Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins), was an English actress who had sacrificed her career for a family. Sigourney grew up in a virtual bubble of guiltless bliss, being taken care of by nannies and maids. By 1959, the Weavers had resided in 30 different households. In 1961, Sigourney began attending the Brearley Girls Academy, but her mother moved her to another New York private school, Chapin. Sigourney was quite rather taller than most of her other classmates (at age 13, she was already 5&apos; 10&quot;), resulting in her constantly being laughed at and picked on; in order to gain their acceptance, she took on the role of class clown.In 1962, her family moved to San Francisco briefly, an unpleasant experience for her. Later, they moved back east to Connecticut, where she became a student at the Ethel Walker School, facing the same problems as before. In 1963, she changed her name to &quot;Sigourney&quot;, after the character Sigourney Howard in F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (her own birth name, Susan, was in honor of her mother&apos;s best friend, explorer Susan Pretzlik). Sigourney had already starred in a school drama production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream&quot;, and, in 1965, she worked during the summer with a stock troupe, performing in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;You Can&apos;t Take It With You&quot; (she did not star in the latter because she was taller than the lead actor). After graduating from school in 1967, she spent some months in a kibbutz in Israel. At that time, she became engaged to reporter Aaron Latham, but they soon separated.In 1969, Sigourney enrolled in Stanford University, majoring in English Literature. She also participated in school plays, especially Japanese Noh plays. By that time, she was living in a tree house, alongside a male friend, dressed in elf-like clothes! After completing her studies in 1971, she applied for the Yale School of Drama in New Haven. Despite appearing at the audition reading a Bertolt Brecht speech and wearing a rope-like belt, she was accepted by the school but her professors rejected her, because of her height, and kept typecasting her as prostitutes and old women (whereas classmate Meryl Streep was treated almost reverently). However, in 1973, while making her theatrical debut with &quot;Watergate Classics&quot;, she met up with a team of playwrights and actors and began hanging around with them, resulting in long-term friendships with Christopher Durang, Kate McGregor-Stewart and Albert Innaurato.In 1974, she starred in such plays as Aristophanes&apos; &quot;Frogs&quot; and Durang&apos;s &quot;The Nature and Purpose of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Daryl and Carol and Kenny and Jenny&quot;, as &quot;Jenny&quot;. After finishing her studies that year, she began seriously pursuing a stage career, but her height kept being a hindrance. However, she continued working on stage with Durang (in &quot;Titanic&quot; [1975]) and Innaurato (in &quot;Gemini&quot; [1976]). Other 1970s stage works included &quot;Marco Polo Sing a Song&quot;, &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot;, &quot;The Constant Husband&quot;, &quot;Conjuring an Event&quot; and others. However, the one that really got her noticed was &quot;Das Lusitania Songspiel&quot;, a play she co-wrote with Durang and in which she starred for two seasons, from 1979 to 1981. She was also up for a Drama Desk Award for it. During the mid-1970s, she appeared in several TV spots and even starred as Avis Ryan on the soap opera Somerset (1970).In 1977, she was cast in the role Shelley Duvall finally played in Io e Annie (1977), after rejecting the role due to prior stage commitments. In the end, however, Woody Allen offered her a role in the film that, while short (she was on-screen for six seconds), made many people sit up and take notice. She later appeared in Madman (1978) and, of course, Alien (1979). The role of the tough, uncompromising Ripley made Sigourney an overnight star and brought her a British Award nomination. She next appeared in Uno scomodo testimone (1981) and Un anno vissuto pericolosamente (1982), the latter being a great success in Australia that won an Oscar and brought Sigourney and co-star Mel Gibson to Cannes in 1983. The same year she delivered an honorary Emmy Award to her father, a few months before her uncle, actor Doodles Weaver, committed suicide. That year also brought her a romance with Jim Simpson, her first since having broken up two years previously with James M. McClure. She and Simpson were married on 1 October 1984. Meanwhile, Sigourney had played in the poorly received L&apos;affare del secolo (1983) and the mega-hit Ghostbusters (Acchiappafantasmi) (1984). She was also nominated for a Tony Award for her tour-de-force performance in the play &quot;Hurly Burly&quot;. Then followed Alta, bella e pericolosa (1985), Mistery (1986) and Aliens - Scontro finale (1986). The latter was a huge success, and Sigourney was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar.She then entered her most productive career period and snatched Academy Award nominations, in both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, for her intense portrayal of Dian Fossey in Gorilla nella nebbia (1988) and her delicious performance as a double-crossing, power-hungry corporate executive in Una donna in carriera (1988). She ended up losing in both, but made up for it to a degree by winning both Golden Globe Awards. After appearing in a documentary about fashion photographer Helmut Newton, Helmut Newton: Frames from the Edge (1989), and reprising her role in the sequel Ghostbusters II (Acchiappafantasmi II) (1989), she discovered she was pregnant and retired from public life for a while. She gave birth to her daughter, Charlotte Simpson, on 13 April 1990, and returned to the movies as a now skinhead Ripley in AlienÂ³ (1992) and a gorgeous Queen Isabella of Spain in 1492 - La conquista del paradiso (1992), her second film with director Ridley Scott. She starred in the political comedy Dave - Presidente per un giorno (1993) alongside Kevin Kline, and then a Roman Polanski thriller, La morte e la fanciulla (1994).In 1995, she was seen in the romantic comedy Jeffrey (1995) and the mystery thriller Copycat - Omicidi in serie (1995). The next year, she &quot;trod the boards&quot; in &quot;Sex and Longing&quot;, yet another Durang play. She had not performed in the theater in many years before that play, her last stage performances occurring in the 1980s in &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1981), &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; (1981), &quot;The Marriage of &apos;Bette and Boo&apos;&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1986). In 1997, she was the protagonist in Biancaneve nella Foresta Nera (1997), Tempesta di ghiaccio (1997) and Alien - La clonazione (1997). Her performance in Tempesta di ghiaccio (1997) gained her a BAFTA Award and another Golden Globe Award nomination. She also gave excellent performances in La mappa del mondo (1999) and the sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest (1999). However, her next comedy Una spia per caso (2000) was not quite so warmly welcomed critically and financially. She next played a sexy con artist in Heartbreakers - Vizio di famiglia (2001) and had a voice role in Big Bad Love (2001). Her father died at age 93. Sigourney herself has recently starred in Tadpole (2002) and is planning a cinematic version of The Guys (2002), the enthralling September 11th one-act drama she played on stage on late 2001. At age 60, she played a crucial role in Avatar (2009), which became the top box-office hit of all time. The film reunited her with her Aliens - Scontro finale (1986) director James Cameron. Her beauty, talent, and hard-work keeps the ageless actress going, and she has continued to win respect from her fans and directors.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for playing wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts.Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene Kassel, and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly &quot;discovered&quot; whilst working in a cafÃ© in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye &quot;David Addison&quot; alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Moonlighting (1985). His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective &quot;John McClane&quot; in the monster hit Trappola di cristallo (1988), in which Willis&apos; character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel, 58 minuti per morire - Die Harder (1990), set at a snowbound Washington&apos;s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Die Hard - Duri a morire (1995), this time co-starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shop owner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in New York.Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of &quot;Mikey&quot; the baby in the very popular family comedies Senti chi parla (1989), and its sequel Senti chi parla 2 (1990) also starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. Il falÃ² delle vanitÃ  (1990) and Hudson Hawk - Il mago del furto (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyper-violent L&apos;ultimo boy scout - Missione: sopravvivere (1991), the darkly humored La morte ti fa bella (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Impatto imminente (1993).During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing Genitori cercasi (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in the Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Pulp Fiction (1994), the Terry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller L&apos;esercito delle 12 scimmie (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus Il quinto elemento (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic The Sixth Sense - Il sesto senso (1999).Willis next starred in the gangster comedy FBI - Protezione testimoni (2000), worked again with &quot;hot&quot; director M. Night Shyamalan in the less than gripping Unbreakable - Il predestinato (2000), and in two military dramas, Sotto corte marziale (2002) and L&apos;ultima alba (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Sin City (2005), the voice of &quot;RJ&quot; the scheming raccoon in the animated hit La gang del bosco (2006) and &quot;Die Hard&quot; fans rejoiced to see &quot;John McClane&quot; return to the big screen in the high tech Die Hard - Vivere o morire (2007) aka &quot;Die Hard 4.0&quot;.Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in southern China, John Woo grew up in Hong Kong, where he began his film career as an assistant director in 1969, working for Shaw Brothers Studios. He directed his first feature in 1973 and has been a prolific director ever since, working in a wide variety of genres before A Better Tomorrow (1986) established his reputation as a master stylist specializing in ultra-violent gangster films and thrillers, with hugely elaborate action scenes shot with breathtaking panache. After gaining a cult reputation in the US with The Killer (1989), Woo was offered a Hollywood contract. He now works in the US.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Hacks are nothing new in Hollywood. Since the beginning of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century, thousands of untalented people have come to Los Angeles from all over America and abroad to try to make it big (as writers, producers, directors, actors, talent agents, singers, composers, musicians, artists, etc.) but who end up using, scamming and exploiting other people for money as well as using their creative ability (either self-taught or professional training), leading to the production of dull, bland, mediocre, unimaginative, inferior, trite work in the forlorn hope of attaining commercial success. Had Edward D. Wood, Jr. been born a decade or two earlier, it&apos;s easy to imagine him working for some Poverty Row outfit in Gower Gulch, competing with the likes of no-talent and no-taste producers and directors--such as Victor Adamson, Robert J. Horner and Dwain Esper--for the title of all-time hack. He would have fit in nicely working at Weiss Brothers-Artclass Pictures in the early 1930s in directing low budget Western-themed serials, or directing low budget film noir crime drama features at PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) in the following decade from 1940 to 1946. Ed Wood is the probably the most well known of all the Hollywood hacks because he is imprisoned in his own time, and in the 1950s, Ed Wood simply had no competition. He was ignored throughout his spectacularly unsuccessful film making career and died a penniless alcoholic, only to be &quot;rediscovered&quot; when promoters in the early 1980s tagged him &quot;The Worst Director of All Time&quot; (mostly thanks to the Medveds&apos; hilarious book, &quot;Golden Turkey Awards&quot;) and he was given the singular honor of a full-length biopic by Tim Burton (Ed Wood (1994)). This post-mortem celebrity has made him infinitely more famous today than he ever was during his lifetime.Wood was an exceedingly complex person. He was born on October 10, 1924, in Poughkeepsie, NY, where he lived most of his childhood. He joined the US Marine Corps in 1943 at the height of World War II and was, by all accounts, an exemplary soldier, wounded in ferocious combat in the Pacific theater (a transvestite, he claimed to have been wearing a bra and panties under his uniform while storming ashore during the bloody beachhead landing at Tarawa in November 1943). He was habitually optimistic, even in the face of the bleak realities that would later consume him. His personality bonded him with a small clique of outcasts who eked out life on the far edges of the Hollywood fringe.After settling in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, Wood attempted to break into the film industry, initially without success, but in 1952 he landed the chance to direct a film based on the real-life Christine Jorgensen sex-change story, then a hot topic. The result, Glen or Glenda (1953), gave a fascinating insight into Wood&apos;s own personality and shed light on his transvestism (an almost unthinkable subject for an early 1950s mainstream feature). Although devoutly heterosexual, Wood was an enthusiastic cross-dresser, with a particular fondness for angora. On the debit side, though, the film revealed the almost complete lack of talent that would mar all his subsequent films, his tendency to resort to stock footage of lightning during dramatic moments, laughable set design and a near-incomprehensible performance by Bela Lugosi as a mad doctor whose presence is never adequately explained. The film deservedly flopped miserably but Wood, always upbeat, pressed ahead.Wood&apos;s main problem was that he saw himself as a producer-writer-director, when in fact he was spectacularly incompetent in all three capacities. Friends who knew Wood have described him as an eccentric, oddball hack who was far more interested in the work required in cobbling a film project together than in ever learning the craft of film making itself or in any type of realism. In an alternate universe, Wood might have been a competent producer if he had better industry connections and an even remotely competent director. Wood, however, likened himself to his idol, Orson Welles, and became a triple threat: bad producer, poor screenwriter and God-awful director. All of his films exhibit illogical continuity, bizarre narratives and give the distinct impression that a director&apos;s job was simply to expose the least amount of film possible due to crushing budget constraints. His magnum opus, Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957), features visible wires connected to pie-pan UFOs, actors knocking over cardboard &quot;headstones&quot;, cars changing models and years during chase sequences, scenes exhibiting a disturbing lack of handgun safety and the ingenious use of shower curtains in airplane cockpits that have virtually no equipment are just a few of the trademarks of that Edward D. Wood Jr. production. When criticized for their innumerable flaws, Wood would cheerfully explain his interpretation of the suspension of disbelief. It&apos;s not so much that he made movies so badly without regard to realism--the amazing part is that he managed to get them made at all.His previous film with Lugosi, La sposa del mostro (1955), was no better (unbelievably, it somehow managed to earn a small profit during its original release, undoubtedly more of a testament to how cheaply it was produced than its value as entertainment), and Wood only shot a few seconds of silent footage of Lugosi (doped and dazed, wandering around the front yard of his house) for &quot;Plan 9&quot; before the actor died in August 1956. What few reviews the film received were brutal. Typically undaunted, Wood soldiered on despite incoherent material and a microscopic budget, peopling it with his regular band of mostly inept actors. Given the level of dialog, budget and Wood&apos;s dismal directorial abilities, it&apos;s unlikely that better actors would have made much of a difference (lead actor Gregory Walcott made his debut in this film and went on to have a very respectable career as a character actor, but was always embarrassed by his participation in this film)--in fact, it&apos;s the film&apos;s semi-official status as arguably the Worst Film Ever Made that gives it its substantial cult following. The film, financed by a local Baptist congregation led by Wood&apos;s landlord, reaches a plateau of ineptitude that tends to leave viewers open-mouthed, wondering what is it they just saw. &quot;Plan 9&quot; became, whether Wood realized it or not, his singular enduring legacy. Ironically, the rights to the film were retained by the church and it is unlikely that Wood ever received a dime from it; his epic bombed upon release in 1959 and remained largely forgotten for years to come.After this career &quot;peak,&quot; Wood went into, relatively speaking, a decline. Always an &quot;enthusiastic&quot;--for lack of a better word--drinker, his alcohol addiction worsened in the 1960s due to his depression of not achieving the worldwide fame he had always sought. He began to draw away from film directing and focused most of his time on another profession: writing. Beginning in the early 1960s up until his death, Wood wrote at least 80 lurid crime and sex paperback novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines and daily newspapers. Thirty-two stories known to be written by Wood (he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms such as &quot;Ann Gora&quot; and &quot;Dr. T.K. Peters&quot;) are collected in &apos;Blood Splatters Quickly&apos;, published by OR Books in 2014. Novels include Black Lace Drag (1963) (reissued in 1965 as Killer in Drag), Orgy of the Dead (1965), Devil Girls (1967), Death of a Transvestite (1967), The Sexecutives (1968), The Photographer (1969), Take It Out in Trade (1970), The Only House in Town (1970), Necromania (1971), The Undergraduate (1972), A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies (1973) and Fugitive Girls (1974).In 1965, Wood wrote the quasi-memoir &apos;Hollywood Rat Race&apos;, which was eventually published in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to &quot;just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you&apos;ll get better&quot;, and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub cabaret.In the 1970s, Wood directed a number of undistinguished softcore and later hardcore adult porno films under various aliases, one of which is the name &quot;Akdov Telmig&quot; (&quot;vodka gimlet&quot; spelled backwards; it helps to imagine that you&apos;re a boozy dyslexic, as Ed Wood was). His final years were spent largely drunk in his apartment and occasionally being rolled stumbling out of a local liquor store. Three days before his death, Wood and his wife Kathy were evicted from their Hollywood apartment due to failure to pay the rent and moved into a friend&apos;s apartment shortly before his death on the afternoon of December 10, 1978, at age 54. He had a heart attack and died while drinking in bed.Due to his recent resurgence in popularity, many of his equally bizarre transvestite-themed sex novels have been republished. The gravitational pull of Planet Angora remains quite strong.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James Howard Woods was born on April 18, 1947 in Vernal, Utah, the son of Martha A. (Smith) and Gail Peyton Woods, a U.S. Army intelligence officer who died during Woods&apos; childhood. James is of Irish, English, and German descent. He grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island, with his mother and stepfather Thomas E. Dixon. He graduated from Pilgrim High School in 1965, near the top of his class. James earned a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; dropping out during his sophomore year in 1967, he then headed off to New York with his fraternity brother Martin Donovan to pursue aspirations to appear on the stage. After appearing in a handful of New York City theater productions, Woods scored his first film role in All the Way Home (1971) and followed that up with meager supporting roles in Come eravamo (1973) and I ragazzi del coro (1977).However, it was Woods&apos; cold-blooded performance as the cop killer in Il campo di cipolle (1979), based on a Joseph Wambaugh novel, that seized the attention of movie-goers to his on-screen power. Woods quickly followed up with another role in another Joseph Wambaugh film adaptation, The Black Marble (1980), as a sleazy and unstable cable-T.V.-station owner in David Cronenberg&apos;s mind-bending and prophetic Videodrome (1983), as gangster Max Bercovicz in Sergio Leones mammoth epic C&apos;era una volta in America (1984), and scored a best actor Academy Award nomination as abrasive journalist Richard Boyle in Oliver Stone&apos;s gritty and unsettling Salvador (1986).There seemed to be no stopping the rise of this star as he continued to amaze movie-goers with his remarkable versatility and his ability to create such intense, memorable characters. The decade of the 1990s started off strongly with high praise for his role as Roy Cohn in the television production of Citizen Cohn (1992). Woods was equally impressive as sneaky hustler Lester Diamond who cons Sharon Stone in CasinÃ² (1995), made a tremendous H.R. Haldeman in Gli intrighi del potere - Nixon (1995), portrayed serial killer Carl Panzram in Killer - diario di un assassino (1995), and then as accused civil rights assassin Byron De La Beckwith in L&apos;agguato - Ghosts from the past (1996).Not to be typecast solely as hostile hoodlums, Woods has further expanded his range to encompass providing voice-overs for animated productions including Hercules (1997), Hooves of Fire (1999), and Stuart Little 2 (2002). Woods also appeared in the critically praised Il giardino delle vergini suicide (1999), in the coming-of-age movie I ragazzi della mia vita (2001), as a corrupt medico in Ogni maledetta domenica (1999), and in the comedy-horror spoof Scary Movie 2 (2001). A remarkable performer with an incredibly diverse range of acting talent, Woods remains one of Hollywood&apos;s outstanding leading men.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">RenÃ©e Kathleen Zellweger was born on April 25, 1969, in Katy, Texas, Her mother, Kjellfrid Irene (Andreassen), is a Norwegian-born former nurse and midwife, of Norwegian, Kven (Finnish), and Swedish descent. Her father, Emil Erich Zellweger, is a Swiss-born engineer. The two married in 1963. RenÃ©e has a brother named Drew Zellweger, a marketing executive born on February 15, 1967. RenÃ©e got interested in acting in high school while working on the drama club. She also took an acting class at the University of Texas (Austin), where she began looking towards acting as a career. After graduation, she wanted to continue acting, but Hollywood is a tough town to break into, so RenÃ©e decided to stay in Texas, and auditioned for roles around Houston, where she managed to grab roles in such films as Giovani, carini e disoccupati (1994) and Empire Records (1995).While on the set for the sequel, Non aprite quella porta IV (1995), she befriended Matthew McConaughey, another Hollywood up-and-comer. He was working on a project at the time that RenÃ©e was interested in, auditioned for, and won the role in the film Love e una .45 (1994), which earned her enough critical praise that she decided to move to Los Angeles. Another role in Il mondo intero (1996) followed which led to her big break. Cameron Crowe was busy casting his next film, Jerry Maguire (1996),starring Tom Cruise. Crowe was considering such actresses as Cameron Diaz, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder, and Marisa Tomei, when he heard of Zellweger&apos;s performance in Il mondo intero (1996). He auditioned Zellweger and was sure he&apos;d found his Dorothy Boyd.RenÃ©e followed her huge success with a few small independent films and after receiving further critical praise, she felt confident enough to reenter the world of big-budget Hollywood films. She starred opposite Meryl Streep in the tear-jerker La voce dell&apos;amore (1998). She also took a role in Io, me &amp; Irene (2000), opposite Jim Carrey, and soon after began dating Carrey. The two denied their relationship at first, but finally gave in and admitted it; today they are no longer together. Also in 2000, she starred in the title role in Betty Love (2000), where she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical. In 2001, she received even more critical and commercial success in the title role in Il diario di Bridget Jones (2001). She received her first Academy Award nomination for her role, which was followed by her second Oscar-nominated role in the musical Chicago (2002). She then again wowed audiences with her fierce yet warm portrayal of Ruby Thewes in the film adaptation of Ritorno a Cold Mountain (2003), which won Zellweger an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which was her first Academy Award. She won her second, for Best Actress, 16 years later, playing Judy Garland in Judy (2019).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">American actor and filmmaker Benjamin GÃ©za Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California, and was raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother, Chris Anne (nÃ©e Boldt), is a school teacher, and his father, Timothy Byers Affleck, is a social worker; the two are divorced. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, GÃ©za, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.Affleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben&apos;s teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including Hands of a Stranger (1987) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in La vita Ã¨ un sogno (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith&apos;s Generazione X (1995) and In cerca di Amy (1997) which were great for Ben&apos;s career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn&apos;t last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Will Hunting - Genio ribelle (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn&apos;t willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Will Hunting - Genio ribelle (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben&apos;s breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon - Giudizio finale (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Ipotesi di reato (2002), Al vertice della tensione (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Amore estremo - Tough Love (2003) and Natale in affitto (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin&apos; Aces (2006), La veritÃ  Ã¨ che non gli piaci abbastanza (2009), State of Play (2009), and Extract (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck&apos;s second Oscar win).In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller L&apos;amore bugiardo - Gone Girl (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), briefly reprised the character in Suicide Squad (2016), and did so again in Justice League (2017).Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005. The couple has three children. In June 2015, Affleck and Garner separated, and in April 2017 they filed for divorce.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in Manhattan and raised in Los Angeles, Stephanie grew up swimming, riding, playing tennis, dancing, diving, clowning around, doing chores, and living the normal life of a tomboy in the great expanse of the San Fernando Valley. As a very young amateur theatrical entrepreneur, she produced, wrote, and directed pieces in her little bedroom hallway, in the stable, and on neighbors&apos; fireplace hearths, earning her the title, &quot;the boss&quot;.But Stephanie&apos;s abiding love of theater was kindled at Brown Ledge Camp in Mallett&apos;s Bay, Vermont, where she acted, sang, and was nurtured in theater craft for six summers. Friends she made there count among her friends today.Eager to get on with it, she created her own independent project in her senior year at Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia: she returned to Los Angeles to study acting, movement, voice, tap and ballet. After graduating cum laude from high school, Stephanie&apos;s ambitions led her to choose a professional drama school over university, and she spent a challenging time in New York &quot;getting a dose of it&quot;.Returning to Los Angeles once again, she worked for her brother and sister-in-law&apos;s company, &quot;Correia Art Glass&quot;, while she made the audition rounds. In time, she gave up packing glass to star in television movies, among them the Emmy Award-winning L&apos;albero di Natale Ã¨ sempre verde (1977), Colorado (1978), Olimpiade: un amore (1980) and Progetto Genesi (1982), along with the occasional guest series role. After several such projects and two feature films - La piÃ¹ bella avventura di Lassie (1978), with James Stewart, and Alla 39Âª eclisse (1980), with Charlton Heston - Stephanie was offered the role of &quot;Laura Holt&quot; in the MTM series, Mai dire sÃ¬ (1982), which she played for five years with Pierce Brosnan and Doris Roberts on NBC. She appeared as Caroline? (1990) for Hallmark on CBS, which won three Emmys and earned her a Golden Globe nomination. Subsequently, Stephanie starred in La signora delle fiabe (1991) with Jessica Tandy, Un processo in provincia (1994) for CBS with Walter Matthau and Harry Morgan, and Stop the World, I Want to Get Off (1996), the musical, on A&amp;E, to name a few of her more than thirty television movie appearances.Stephanie starred in Lifetime Television&apos;s 50th movie, L&apos;inferno dietro quel cancello (1997), followed by an episode of Il tocco di un angelo (1994), their highest-rated show to that date. She was happy to be back in the saddle, in Ventura and Ojai, no less, filming an independent movie with Dennis Hopper called Profezie di morte (2000), followed by Borderline Normal (2001) in Saskatchewan, Malpractice (2001) in New Orleans, and another Il tocco di un angelo (1994). More recently, she spent a happy time guesting on Crossing Jordan (2001).Striving for excellence has always been very important to Stephanie, partly due to the standards set by her illustrious family. Alma Gluck, her grandmother, was one of the great sopranos of her day. Efrem Zimbalist Sr., her beloved grandfather, was a celebrated violinist, composer, and gifted teacher and director of the Curtis Institute of Music. Her aunt, Marcia Davenport, was a brilliant historical writer and novelist. Her wonderful father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., is a prize-winning Broadway producer (Gian Carlo Menotti&apos;s &quot;The Consul&quot;, &quot;The Medium&quot; and &quot;The Telephone&quot;), gifted composer, and celebrated actor (Indirizzo permanente (1958), F.B.I. (1965), and many movies). His stunning &quot;Violin Sonata&quot; has been performed at several summer concert series. Her brother Efrem (&quot;Skip&quot;) and his company, &quot;Active Interest Media&quot;, publish several magazines.After debuting on stage in the musical &quot;Festival&quot; in 1979 at the Las Palmas Theater in Los Angeles with Gregory Harrison and Brian Stokes Mitchell, Stephanie appeared as &quot;Miranda&quot; in &quot;The Tempest&quot; with Anthony Hopkins and Brent Carver at the Mark Taper Forum. Other theater includes &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at the Long Wharf Theater, &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; and &quot;Barbarians&quot; at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, and the national tour of &quot;My One And Only&quot; with Tommy Tune. In 1989, she initiated a play to be written for her and Linda Purl, and directed by Jenny Sullivan - &quot;The Baby Dance&quot; by Jane Anderson - which they produced and starred in at the Pasadena Playhouse. The production moved to Williamstown and Long Wharf, and culminated in a critically-acclaimed run at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York City. She played &quot;Polly Peacham&quot; in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; with Betty Buckley at Williamstown, and had a wonderful time with &quot;Tracy Lord&quot; in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; at the Cleveland PlayHouse. In 1994, Stephanie took on the double roles of an Irish peasant and a New Bedford fisherman&apos;s wife in the original production of &quot;The Crimson Thread&quot; in Connecticut (which she co-produced), and the Pasadena Playhouse. A second tread on the L.A. boards under Jenny Sullivan&apos;s direction was the hilarious, tour de force turn as a nail-spitting media barracuda in the West Coast premiere of &quot;AdWars&quot; with the wonderful David Dukes (R.I.P.).At L.A.&apos;s Coronet Theater for many months, Stephanie kicked up a lot of sand as the lovable dog in A.R. Gurney&apos;s &quot;Sylvia&quot;. In 1998, she starred in the world premiere of Jane Martin&apos;s &quot;Mr. Bundy&quot; at the Humana Festival of Actors Theatre of Louisville, and happily played opposite Lucie Arnaz in &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; for the Reprise! series in L.A. Stephanie was thrilled to be reunited with her dear &quot;Baby Dance&quot; friends, John Bennett Perry and Jenny Sullivan for the Rubicon Theatre&apos;s award-winning, double run of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;. A dream came true, tackling the towering role of &quot;Terry&quot; in Warren Leight&apos;s knockout &quot;Side Man&quot; at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, followed by a tour of &quot;Accomplice&quot; on the east coast (after a month&apos;s holiday in London, St. Petersberg, Moscow, Rostov [birthplace of her grandfather, Efrem Zimbalist Sr.], Istanbul, Athens, and sailing the Dodecanes!). For several springs now, Stephanie has opened the Tennessee Williams New Orleans Literary Festival with a reading of one of his plays at their Gala event - she&apos;s happily shared those boards with Alec Baldwin, Elizabeth Ashley, John Goodman, Patricia Neal, Linda Hart, and the charming Rex Reed. Having worked in New Orleans with the Festival and in Malpractice (2001) and made friends in Nola, the recent tragedies there hit especially hard.Stephanie had another dream come true, to play &quot;Varya&quot; in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, with the added thrill of playing opposite one of her acting heroes, the amazing and delightful Alfred Molina. Recently, she played &quot;Ursula&quot; in Nicholas Wright&apos;s wonderful play, &quot;Vincent in Brixton&quot;, at the Pasadena Playhouse. Also at the Rubicon Theatre, she&apos;s played in Brian Friel&apos;s &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, Jane Anderson&apos;s &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, and trod the boards with her father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., for the first time, in Tennessee Williams&apos;s &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in Rockford, Illinois, on December 14, 1962, Ginger Lynn Allen went to California in 1982 to visit her ill grandfather. She decided to stay and found employment as a manager at a Musicland record store in Redlands. She had lived in a trailer in one of the worst parts of the city for almost a year when she answered an ad for figure models. This led to employment the same day and a layout in Penthouse magazine. Work in the adult-film industry soon followed. She worked in the industry from December 1983 through February 1986, making a total of 69 films (plus countless re-issues and compilations). She retired, partially because the work was no longer fun and she had very little time off. That same year, she was approached by the FBI to testify on behalf of Traci Lords, who had just been exposed as having been underage during her years in the adult-film industry. She refused and was eventually arrested for tax evasion. Following her years in adult movies, she appeared in many &quot;legit&quot; films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s-- most notably the &quot;Vice Academy&quot; films. She also starred in Metallica&apos;s music video &quot;Turn the Page.&quot; She has a son, who she gave birth to on March 24, 1996. She tours gentlemen&apos;s clubs around the country, and signed a comeback deal with VCA Pictures in 1999. She has starred in four new adult movies so far: Torn (1999), White Lightning (2000), New Wave Hookers 6 (2000) and Taken (2001).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Joan Allen was born on August 20, 1956 in Rochelle, Illinois, the youngest of four children. She is the daughter of homemaker Dorothea Marie (Wirth) and gas station owner James Jefferson Allen. Her mother&apos;s family was German, and her father had English, Scots-Irish, and German ancestry. She attended Rochelle Township High School where she was voted most likely to succeed. Joining Chicago&apos;s famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company ensemble in 1977, she was one of the group&apos;s original members and starred in a number of its original productions. Her first major film credits included two critically-lauded supporting performances that showcased her versatility: a comedic turn in the suburban murder mystery Posizioni compromettenti (1985) and a dramatic role as a blind woman befriended by a serial killer in Manhunter - Frammenti di un omicidio (1986). Around the same time, Allen was making a name for herself on the New York stage; she would eventually become one of the New York theater world&apos;s most honored actresses and a winner of every major prize for her work on Broadway and off. She received a Best Actress Tony Award in 1988 for her performance, opposite John Malkovich, in Lanford Wilson&apos;s Burn This and was Tony-nominated in the same category in 1989 for the title role in The Heidi Chronicles.Continuing her work in film as well, Allen received her first Academy Award nomination for her role as Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone&apos;s Gli intrighi del potere - Nixon (1995), for which she also won awards from seven critics&apos; associations, including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics.

Macy and Jeff Daniels, earned her high praise and several critics&apos; awards; she also co-starred in the action blockbuster Face/Off - Due facce di un assassino (1997) opposite John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. For her starring role in The Contender (2000), Allen received Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards, the SAG Awards, and the Independent Spirit Awards.Throughout the early 2000s Allen worked in both film and television, with roles in three of the Bourne films - The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne Ultimatum - Il ritorno dello sciacallo (2007), and The Bourne Legacy (2012) - as well as Le pagine della nostra vita (2004), Litigi d&apos;amore (2005), and Death Race (2008).

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Karen Jane Allen was born in Carrollton, rural southern Illinois, to Patricia (Howell), a teacher, and Carroll Thompson Allen, an FBI agent. She spent her first 10 years traveling around the country with her parents and two sisters. She was always &quot;the new girl in school.&quot; Acting did not really cross Allen&apos;s mind until she was in her early 20s, when she saw a Jerzy Grotowski theater production that impressed her so much, she instantly decided to give it a shot. She trained as a classical actress and enrolled at the Actors Studio and with Lee Strasberg in New York City. During this period, she made several student films and directed and acted in several plays. In 1976, she made her first film appearance in the award-winning small film The Whidjitmaker (1976).Her first major film role came as Katy in 1978&apos;s National Lampoon&apos;s Animal House (1978), which became one of the biggest hits of the year, obtained &quot;classic&quot; status, and launched a whole host of young &quot;hot&quot; stars. However, shortly after Animal House (1978) opened, Allen was struck by a rare and dangerous eyesight condition called keratoconjunctivitis. Luckily, the condition subsided and Allen could continue her dramatic rise to the top. Lead roles in cult favorites like The Wanderers - I nuovi guerrieri (1979) and the controversial thriller Cruising (1980) followed, as did smaller parts as in Woody Allen&apos;s Manhattan (1979). However, it was her performance in Rob Cohen&apos;s Una piccola cerchia di amici (1980), as well as her previously mentioned turn in Animal House (1978), that caught the eye of a certain Steven Spielberg. He then cast her as the feisty heroine and co-star of Harrison Ford in his big-budget blockbuster I predatori dell&apos;arca perduta (1981), which became a huge hit in 1981-82 and is regarded by many film buffs as the greatest action-adventure film ever made.Following the huge success of I predatori dell&apos;arca perduta (1981), Allen chose to spend more than two years out of the limelight, concentrating on smaller, more personal projects. She won a major award for her performances on Broadway, won critical acclaim for her portrayal of Abra in the hugely successful ABC production of La valle dell&apos;Eden (1981), and had parts in two smaller films: Alan Parker&apos;s Spara alla luna (1982) and Punto debole (1982), co-starring James Woods and Peter Fonda. She returned to the mainstream in 1984 with Until September (1984) and Starman (1984), co-starring Jeff Bridges and directed by John Carpenter (of Halloween - La notte delle streghe (1978) fame), but once again decided to leave the limelight for a couple of years to do more stage work and some troubled indie films. While Allen has worked almost constantly since then, giving notable performances in Paul Newman&apos;s screen adaptation of Lo zoo di vetro (1987), the Christmas hit S.O.S. fantasmi (1988), and Steven Soderbergh&apos;s underrated Piccolo, grande Aaron (1993), she has not been able to scale the same dizzy heights as the early 1980s hits. Most of her lead roles in feature films since Starman (1984) have not been that well-received (Animal Behavior (1989), Killer machine (1993), and The Turning (1992) among them). However, she has been seen to good effect on TV in such films as Challenger - lo shuttle della morte (1990), in which she portrayed tragic schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, and L&apos;inverno del nostro amore (1997), co-starring Richard Chamberlain.She has also made special guest star appearances on such shows as Law &amp; Order - I due volti della giustizia (1990), California (1979), and Alfred Hitchcock presenta (1985), and in several TV movies, including Le ragioni di una donna (1996) and Arma segreta (1990). She also played the lead in the CBS series The Road Home (1994). Karen Allen was married to soap star Kale Browne (with whom she co-starred in Solo se il destino (1997)) in 1988 and they have a son, Nicholas. Apart from acting, Allen is also an accomplished singer, songwriter, and musician. She played in a band with Kathleen Turner, and recorded a duet with Jeff Bridges for the Starman (1984) soundtrack album.She also writes plays, screenplays, and poetry; owns her own Ashtanga yoga enterprise; and spends time at her Berkshire Mountains farm or Upper West Side Manhattan townhouse. The classically trained actress also has a screenplay called &quot;The Second Coming,&quot; which is about to be made into a movie. Most recently she has starred opposite Peter Coyote in The Basket (1999), and appeared in the blockbuster La tempesta perfetta (2000), in which she co-starred with George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Diane Lane. In addition to these, she is working on Shaka Zulu: The Citadel (2001) and recently made an independent film, In the Bedroom (2001). Karen Allen is undoubtedly one of the most talented, ambitious, and versatile actresses of the last 20 years. In many ways, her own choices to &quot;go back to theater and smaller projects&quot; are the only things that have really stopped her being a major, major star. Allen was voted one of the most beautiful women in the world in 1983, and is a naturally attractive lady - who often plays characters significantly younger than herself. She also often plays unglamorous types - and there is no one better at portraying real, human, and wholly believable people.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Nancy Anne Allen was the daughter of a police lieutenant from Yonkers, New York. At a young age, she trained for a dancing career at the High School of Performing Arts, and then attended Jose Quintano&apos;s School for Young Professionals. In dozens of television commercials from the age of 15, Nancy made her first film appearance in L&apos;ultima corvÃ¨ (1973) with Jack Nicholson. Three years later, she set the standard for all future &quot;bitch-goddess teenagers&quot; as Chris Hargensen in Stephen King&apos;s Carrie - Lo sguardo di Satana (1976), taken to the big screen by director Brian De Palma. Nancy then married De Palma in 1979. She next appeared in Steven Spielberg&apos;s 1964: Allarme a N.Y. arrivano i Beatles! (1978); for the next few years, she appeared only in De Palma&apos;s films: Home Movies - Vizietti familiari (1979), Vestito per uccidere (1980), and she starred with John Travolta in Blow Out (1981).After her divorce from De Palma in 1984, Nancy&apos;s film opportunities were supposedly narrowed, but then she surprised the whole world in 1987 when she performed as Officer Anne Lewis in the sci-fi cult film RoboCop (1987), along with Peter Weller. Here, she set another standard as a tough but at the same time feminine policewoman, whose sex would not interfere with her actions. After the success of RoboCop, she performed as Patricia Gardner in the second sequel in the Poltergeist series. She came back in RoboCop 2 (1990) and in order to get more involved with the character Nancy Allen learned martial arts and police training for real. She returned again in RoboCop 3 (1993), though her co-star Peter Weller did not this time. In 1993, Nancy joined several other veteran stars in Impulso omicida (1993), and married co-star Craig Shoemaker, in the same year. A few years later, she divorced Craig and some time after she married again.Later, she appeared in some diverse films: Dusting Cliff 7 (1997) Secret of the Andes (1998), Circuit (2001), and she had a guest appearance in Steven Soderbergh&apos;s Out of Sight (1998). Her last performance was for the television series Law &amp; Order: UnitÃ  Speciale (1999), in the episode &quot;Escape&quot; aired on December 2, 2003. Allen has recently appeared in several documentaries about her most famous films: Acting &apos;Carrie&apos; (2001), _DVD BackStory: RoboCop (2001)_, The Making of &apos;Dressed to Kill&apos; (2001), DVD _ET True Hollywood Stories: The Curse of Poltergeist (2002)_.Interested in projecting the image of a strong but at the same time feminine woman, she managed to get away from the victim roles she was always offered, she also was able to get away from the stereotype of the beautiful but dumb woman in most action films. She is an environmentalist that traded her Volvo car for an Hybrid car in order to set the example. She is also an activist against breast Cancer along with her friend actress Wendie Jo Sperber, who created the foundation WeSpark. Her last appearance on television was on the Inside E! story of her co-star John Travolta and the A&amp;E Biography of Travolta - both appearances in 2004. Nowadays, Nancy Allen lives a quiet life along with her family and friends somewhere in the United States.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The most internationally acclaimed Spanish filmmaker since Luis BuÃ±uel was born in a small town (Calzada de Calatrava) in the impoverished Spanish region of La Mancha. He arrived in Madrid in 1968, and survived by selling used items in the flea-market called El Rastro. AlmodÃ³var couldn&apos;t study filmmaking because he didn&apos;t have the money to afford it. Besides, the filmmaking schools were closed in early 70s by Franco&apos;s government. Instead, he found a job in the Spanish phone company and saved his salary to buy a Super 8 camera. From 1972 to 1978, he devoted himself to make short films with the help of of his friends. The &quot;premieres&quot; of those early films were famous in the rapidly growing world of the Spanish counter-culture. In few years, AlmodÃ³var became a star of &quot;La Movida&quot;, the pop cultural movement of late 70s Madrid. His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom e le altre ragazze del mucchio (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release. In 1987, he and his brother AgustÃ­n AlmodÃ³var established their own production company: El Deseo, S. A. The &quot;AlmodÃ³var phenomenon&quot; has reached all over the world, making his films very popular in many countries.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Robert Altman was born on February 20th, 1925 in Kansas City, Missouri, to B.C. (an insurance salesman) and Helen Altman. He entered St. Peters Catholic school at the age six, and spent a short time at a Catholic high school. From there, he went to Rockhurst High School. It was then that he started exploring the art of exploring sound with the cheap tape recorders available at the time. He was then sent to Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri where he attended through Junior College. In 1945, he enlisted in the US Army Air Forces and became a copilot of a B-24. After his discharge from the military, he became fascinated by movies and he and his first wife, LaVonne Elmer, moved to Hollywood, where Altman tried acting (appearing in the film Sogni proibiti (1947)), songwriting (he wrote a musical intended for Broadway, &quot;The Rumors are Flying&quot;), and screen-writing (he co-wrote the screenplay for the film Squadra mobile 61 (1948) and wrote the story (uncredited) for Tre figli in gamba (1947)), but he could not get a foot hold in Tinseltown. After a brief fling as publicity director with a company in the business of tattooing dogs, Altman finally gave up and returned to his hometown of Kansas City, where he decided he wanted to do some serious work in filmmaking. An old friend of his recommended him to a film production company in Kansas City, the Calvin Co., who hired him in 1950. After a few months of work in writing scripts and editing films, Altman began directing films at Calvin. It was here (while working on documentaries, employee training films, industrial and educational films and advertisements) that he learned much about film making. All in all, Altman pieced together sixty to sixty-five short films for Calvin on every subject imaginable, from football to car crashes, but he kept grasping for more challenging projects. He wrote the screenplay for the Kansas City-produced feature film Corn&apos;s-A-Poppin&apos; (1955), he produced and directed several television commercials including one with the Eileen Ford Agency, he co-created and directed the TV series The Pulse of the City (1953) which ran for one season on the independent Dumont network, and he even had a formative crack at directing local community theater. His big-screen directorial debut came while still at Calvin with The Delinquents (1957) and, by 1956, he left the Calvin Co., and went to Hollywood to direct Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s TV show. From here, he went on to direct a large number of television shows, until he was offered the script for M.A.S.H. (1970) in 1969. He was hardly the producer&apos;s first choice - more than fifteen other directors had already turned it down. This wasn&apos;t his first movie, but it was his first success. After that, he had his share of hits and misses, but I protagonisti (1992) and, more recently, Gosford Park (2001) were particularly well-received.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1936-03-19</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The quintessential jet-set Euro starlet, Ursula Andress was born in the Swiss canton of Berne on March 19, 1936, one of six children in a strict German Protestant family. Although often seeming icily aloof, a restless streak early demonstrated itself in her personality, and she had an impetuous desire to explore the world outside Switzerland. (For instance, she was tracked down by Interpol for running away from boarding school at 17 years old.) The stunning young woman found work as an art model in Rome and did walk-ons in three quickie Italian pictures before coming to Hollywood in 1955 and getting nowhere professionally; a four-month fling with rising star James Dean brought her good publicity but not much else. That same year, at 19, she met and had an affair with fading matinÃ©e idol John Derek, who left his wife Pati Behrs and two kids for Ursula even though she spoke almost no English at the time. In 1957 they eloped in Las Vegas, and the new bride put her acting ambitions on hold for a few years thereafter.1962 saw the virtually unknown Swiss beauty back on the set, playing opposite Sean Connery in the first movie version of Ian Fleming&apos;s fanciful &quot;James Bond&quot; espionage novels, Agente 007 - Licenza di uccidere (1962). Andress&apos; role as bikini-clad Honey Ryder was somewhat brief, and her Swiss/German accent so thick that her entire performance had to be dubbed by a voiceover artist. Nevertheless, her striking looks and smoldering screen presence made a strong impression on moviegoers, immediately establishing her as one of the most desired women in the world and as an ornament to put alongside some of the most bankable talent of the era, such as Elvis Presley in L&apos;idolo di Acapulco (1963) and Dean Martin in I 4 del Texas (1963). In 1965, she was one of several European starlets to co-star in Ciao Pussycat (1965) -- a film that perhaps sums up mid-&apos;60s pop culture better than any other -- written by Woody Allen, starring Allen and Peter Sellers, with music by Burt Bacharach, a title song performed by Tom Jones and much on-screen sexual romping.Andress appeared in many more racy-for-their time movies in both the United States and Europe, including La decima vittima (1965), in which she wore a famously ballistic bra, and La caduta delle aquile (1966), where she was aptly cast as the sultry, insatiable wife of an aristocratic World War I German general. She was also featured in James Bond 007 - Casino Royale (1967), a satirical foray into the world of James Bond, and gave a sparkling performance in the T&amp;A-filled crime caper Colpo da 500 milioni alla National Bank (1970). Roles as a prostitute kidnapped by outlaws in Sole rosso (1971), a stewardess living on the edge in Colpo in canna (1975) and a bombshell nurse hired to titillate a doddering millionaire to death in L&apos;infermiera (1975) all provided plenty of excuses to throw her clothes to the wind. In La montagna del dio cannibale (1978), she was notoriously stripped and slathered in orange paint by a pair of nubiles. Then she took on the sophisticated role of Louise de la Valliere, slinky, conspiratorial mistress of King Louis XIV (Beau Bridges) in The Fifth Musketeer (1979).As for her personal life, Andress separated from Derek in 1964 and got divorced two years later, after falling in love with French superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo on the Malaysian set of L&apos;uomo di Hong Kong (1965). (Ron Ely, John Richardson and Marcello Mastroianni kept her company during interim.) The relationship with Belmondo hit a wall in 1972, and she was next attached to her leading man from L&apos;ultima chance (1973), Italian heartthrob Fabio Testi. When that didn&apos;t work out, Andress jumped into the dating pool, sporadically involved with a host of Lotharios including (but by no means limited to) Dennis Hopper, Franco Nero, John DeLorean and Ryan O&apos;Neal. In 1979, she began what would be a long-term romance with Harry Hamlin, her handsome young co-star from Scontro di titani (1981) (in which she was cast, predictably, as &quot;Aphrodite&quot;). While subsequently traveling in India, Andress&apos; belly began to swell out of her clothing, and she felt very nauseous. What at first seemed a severe case of &quot;Delhi Belly&quot; turned out to be pregnancy, her first and only, at age 43. Hamlin encouraged her to have the baby -- a life-changing decision for a woman who up until then had refused even the responsibility of pets -- and on May 19, 1980, the international sex symbol gave birth to a boy named Dimitri Hamlin amid much hoopla.After the birth of her son, Andress scaled back her career, which now focused on slight European productions, as she was raising Dimitri in Italy. This meant turning down a big-budget Mel Brooks film in lieu of Messico in fiamme (1982) (starring old flame Nero). Occasional television stints on the soap opera Falcon Crest (1981) and critically lauded miniseries Pietro il grande (1986) helped maintain her visibility as an actress. Dumped by Hamlin in 1983, she started seeing Fausto Fagone, a Sicilian student three decades her junior, in 1986. In 1991, she met a new man when things dwindled with Fagone -- karate master Jeff Speakman. Since the breakup of that relationship, her love life has gone undocumented. She last worked on a film in 2005. Ostensibly retired from acting, Ursula makes the rounds of charity events and pops up on foreign talk shows every now and then. She divides her time between family in Switzerland, friends in Virginia and Spain, and her properties in Rome and L.A.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Julia Elizabeth Wells was born on October 1, 1935, in England. Her mother, Barbara Ward (Morris), and stepfather, both vaudeville performers, discovered her freakish but undeniably lovely four-octave singing voice and immediately got her a singing career. She performed in music halls throughout her childhood and teens, and at age 20, she launched her stage career in a London Palladium production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;.Andrew came to Broadway in 1954 with &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, and became a bona fide star two years later in 1956, in the role of Eliza Doolittle in the unprecedented hit &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Her star status continued in 1957, when she starred in the TV-production of Cinderella (1957) and through 1960, when she played &quot;Guenevere&quot; in &quot;Camelot&quot;.In 1963, Walt Disney asked Andrews if she would like to star in his upcoming production, a lavish musical fantasy that combined live-action and animation. She agreed on the condition if she didn&apos;t get the role of Doolittle in the pending film production of My Fair Lady (1964). After Audrey Hepburn was cast in My Fair Lady, Andrews made an auspicious film debut in Walt Disney&apos;s Mary Poppins (1964), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress.Andrews continued to work on Broadway, until the release of Tutti insieme appassionatamente (1965), the highest-grossing movie of its day and one of the highest-grossing of all time. She soon found that audiences identified her only with singing, sugary-sweet nannies and governesses, and were reluctant to accept her in dramatic roles in Tempo di guerra, tempo d&apos;amore (1964) and Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s thriller Il sipario strappato (1966). In addition, the box-office showings of the musicals Julie subsequently made increasingly reflected the negative effects of the musical-film boom that she helped to create. Millie (1967) was for a time the most successful film Universal had released, but it still couldn&apos;t compete with Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music for worldwide acclaim and recognition. Un giorno... di prima mattina (1968) and Operazione crepes suzette (1970) also bombed at the box office.Fortunately, Andrews did not let this keep her down. She worked in nightclubs and hosted a TV variety series in the 1970s. In 1979, Andrews returned to the big screen, appearing in films directed by her husband Blake Edwards, with roles that were entirely different from anything she had been seen in before. Andrews starred in 10 (1979), S.O.B. (1981) and Victor Victoria (1982), which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.She continued acting throughout the 1980s and 1990s in movies and TV, hosting several specials and starring in a short-lived sitcom. In 2001, she starred in Pretty Princess (2001), alongside then-newcomer Anne Hathaway. The family film was one of the most successful G-Rated films of that year, and Andrews reprised her role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi in Principe azzurro cercasi (2004). In recent years, Andrews appeared in L&apos;acchiappadenti (2010), as well as a number of voice roles in Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek Terzo (2007), Come d&apos;incanto (2007), Shrek e vissero felici e contenti (2010), and Cattivissimo me (2010).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Actress and singer Ann-Margret is one of the most famous sex symbols and actresses of the 1960s and beyond. She continued her career through the following decades and into the 21st century.Ann-Margret was born Ann-Margret Olsson in ValsjÃ¶byn, JÃ¤mtland County, Sweden, to Anna Regina (Aronsson) and Carl Gustav Olsson, who worked for an electrical company. She came to America at age 6. She studied at Northwestern University and left for Las Vegas to pursue a career as a singer. Ann-Margret was discovered by George Burns and soon afterward got both a record deal at RCA and a film contract at 20th Century Fox. In 1961, her single &quot;I Just Don&apos;t Understand&quot; charted in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. Her acting debut followed the same year as Bette Davis&apos; daughter in Frank Capra&apos;s Angeli con la pistola (1961). She appeared in the musical Alla fiera per un marito (1962) a year later before her breakthrough in 1963. With Ciao ciao Birdie (1963) and Viva Las Vegas (1964) opposite Elvis Presley, she became a Top 10 Box Office star, teen idol and even Golden Globe nominated actress. She was marketed as Hollywood&apos;s hottest young star and in the years to come got awarded the infamous nickname &quot;sex kitten.&quot; Her following pictures were sometimes ripped apart by critics (Febbre sulla cittÃ  (1965) and La ragazza yÃ¨ yÃ¨ (1966)), sometimes praised (Cincinnati Kid (1965)). She couldn&apos;t escape being typecast because of her great looks. By the late 1960s, her career stalled, and she turned to Italy for new projects. She returned and, by 1970, she was back in the public image with Hollywood films (R.P.M. (1970) opposite Anthony Quinn), Las Vegas sing-and-dance shows and her own television specials. She finally overcame her image with her Oscar-nominated turn in Mike Nichols&apos; Conoscenza carnale (1971) and succeeded in changing her image from sex kitten to respected actress. A near-fatal accident at a Lake Tahoe show in 1972 only momentarily stopped her career. She was again Oscar-nominated in 1975 for Tommy (1975), the rock opera film of the British rock band The Who. Her career continued with successful films throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s. She starred next to Anthony Hopkins in Magic (1978) and appeared in pictures co-starring Walter Matthau, Gene Hackman, Glenda Jackson and Roy Scheider. She even appeared in a television remake of Tennessee Williams&apos;s masterpiece play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 1983. Another late career highlight for her was Due irresistibili brontoloni (1993) as the object of desire for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. She continues to act in movies today.</rdfs:comment>

She was raised in Monte Carlo where she was educated at a convent school. A voracious reader, she discovered Proust at age 15 and felt as though his writings were for her.When she was 17 her father died and the shock of his loss never left her. Shortly before his death Ardant started acting on stage. However following her father&apos;s death she followed his advice and went to university in Aix-en-Provence where she read Political Science. Upon graduation she took a job working for the French embassy in London from which she was sacked for poor time keeping and being dishevelled. The latter was attributed to the social whirl she enjoyed in London.Ardant continued working odd jobs in London before deciding, almost on a whim, to go to drama school. She returned to France for her studies and before long began acting on stage and then on television. At the age of 31 she was contacted by Francois Truffaut who had spotted her in a television drama and wanted to cast her in his film The Woman Next Door (1981).While working together Ardant and Truffaut fell in love and in 1983 she gave birth to their daughter Josephine. Truffaut died a year later from a brain tumour.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alan Arkin is an Academy Award-winning American actor who is also an acclaimed director, producer, author, singer and composer.He was born Alan Wolf Arkin on March 26, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York. His family were Jewish emigrants from Russia and Germany. In 1946, the Arkins moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, California. His father, David I. Arkin, was an artist and writer, who worked as a teacher, and lost his job for merely refusing to answer questions about his political affiliation during the 1950s Red Scare. His father challenged the politically biased dismissal and eventually prevailed, but unfortunately it was after his death. His mother, Beatrice (Wortis) Arkin, a teacher, shared his father&apos;s views. Young Arkin was fond of music and acting, he was taking various acting classes from the age of 10. He attended Franklin High School, in Los Angeles, then Los Angeles City College from 1951 - 1953, and Bennington College in Vermont from 1953 - 1954. He sang in a college folk-band, and was involved in a drama class. He dropped out of college to form the folk music group The Tarriers, in which Arkin was the lead singer and played guitar. He co-wrote the 1956 hit &quot;The Banana Boat Song&quot; - a Jamaican calypso folk song, which became better known as Harry Belafonte&apos;s popular version, and reached #4 on the Billboard chart. At that time Arkin was a struggling young actor who played bit parts on television and on stage, and made a living as a delivery boy, repairman, pot washer and baby sitter. From 1958 - 1968 he performed and recorded with the children&apos;s folk group, The Babysitters. He has also recorded an entire album for the Elektra label titled &quot;Folksongs - Once Over Lightly.&quot;In 1957 Arkin made his first big screen appearance as a lead singer with The Tarriers in Cuban calypso (1957). Then he made his Off-Broadway debut as a singer in &quot;Heloise&quot; (1958). Next year he joined the Compass Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri. There he caught the eye of stage director Bob Sills and became the original member of the &quot;Second City&quot; troupe in Chicago. In 1961 Arkin made his Broadway debut in musical &quot;From the Second City&quot;, for which he wrote lyrics and sketches, then starred as David Kolowitz in the Broadway comedy &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1963), for which he won a Tony Award. He starred in a Broadway musical &quot;From the Second City production, then returned to Broadway as Harry Berlin in &quot;Luv&quot; (1964). Arkin made his directorial debut with an Off-Broadway hit called &quot;Eh?&quot; (1966), which introduced the young actor, named Dustin Hoffman. He won a Drama Desk Award for his direction of the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1969), and another Drama Desk Award for &quot;The White House Murder Case&quot; (1970). He also directed the original version of Neil Simon&apos;s hilarious smash, &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1972), which ran over 500 performances.Arkin earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his feature acting debut in a comedy Arrivano i Russi, arrivano i Russi (1966), by director Norman Jewison, co-starring as Lt. Rozanov, a Soviet submariner who is mistaken for a spy after his boat accidentally wrecks aground in New England. Arkin demonstrated his dramatic range as the psychopathic killer Roat in suspense film Gli occhi della notte (1967), opposite Audrey Hepburn. He reinvented himself as the sensitive deaf-mute in L&apos;urlo del silenzio (1968), for which he received his second Academy Award Nomination as Best Actor in the Leading role. He followed with what remained his best known role as Captain Yossarian in Comma 22 (1970), directed by Mike Nichols and based on the eponymous anti-war novel by Joseph Heller. In it Arkin arguably gave his strongest performance, however, his career suffered because the film initially did not live up to expectations. After a few years of directorial work on television, Arkin made a comeback with an impressive portrayal of doctor Sigmund Freud in Sherlock Holmes: soluzione settepercento (1976). In the early 1980s he acted in three movies that were family affairs, written by his wife, Barbara Dana, and co-starring his son, Adam Arkin.During the 1990s he turned out several notable performances, such as a bitter former baseball player in TNT&apos;s Cooperstown (1993), and as a hilarious psychiatrist opposite John Cusack in L&apos;ultimo contratto (1997). He won raves for his portrayal of a divorced father who struggles to keep his kids enrolled in the Beverly Hills school system in L&apos;altra faccia di Beverly Hills (1998). Arkin gave a brilliant performance opposite Robin Williams in Jakob il bugiardo (1999), a film about the Nazi occupation of Poland. He also returned to the New York stage co-starring with his son, Tony Arkin and Elaine May in &quot;Power Plays&quot;, which he also co-authored. His most recent comeback as a heroin-snorting, sex-crazed, foul-mouthed grandfather in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), earned him his third Academy Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, and his first Academy Award.Alan Arkin has been a modern Renaissance man. In addition to his achievements as an actor, director, and producer, he made his mark as a singer-songwriter with his popular-song compositions &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, &quot;Cuddle Bug,&quot; &quot;That&apos;s Me,&quot; and &quot;Best Time of the Year.&quot; Arkin also authored several books, including science-fiction and some children&apos;s stories, such as &quot;The Clearing&quot;, &quot;The Lemming Condition&quot; and &quot;Cassie Loves Beethoven&quot; among his other publications. He is a father of three sons, Adam Arkin, Matthew Arkin, and Anthony Arkin, and a grandfather of Molly Arkin.Alan Arkin has been a strong supporter of an organic way of living and also a proponent for preservation of the environment and natural habitat. He has been avoiding the show-biz-milieu and is known as an actor who does not really care about prestigious awards, but values having a good job and being acknowledged by his peers. In Arkin&apos;s own words he wants to &quot;Stay home for three months. Living as quietly as humanly possible.&quot; Arkin was given an Indian name, Grey Wolf, by his Native American friends in New Mexico.</rdfs:comment>

Sean was raised by his stepfather, actor John Astin, who married Patty Duke in 1972 and whose surname Sean took. Sean&apos;s mother was of Irish and more distant German ancestry, and Sean&apos;s biological father is of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent.At age nine, Sean starred with his mother in the after-school special Please Don&apos;t Hit Me, Mom (1981).

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Lord Richard Attenborough was born in Cambridge, England, the son of Mary (nÃ©e Clegg), a founding member of the Marriage Guidance Council, and Frederick Levi Attenborough, a scholar and academic administrator who was a don at Emmanuel College and wrote a standard text on Anglo-Saxon law. The family later moved to Leicester where his father was appointed Principal of the university while Richard was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).His film career began with a role as a deserting sailor in Eroi del mare (1942), a part that contributed to his being typecast for many years as a coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Morning Departure (1950) and his breakthrough role as a psychopathic young gangster in the film adaptation of Graham Greene&apos;s novel, Brighton Rock (1948). During World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force.He worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, and in the 1950s appeared in several successful comedies for John Boulting and Roy Boulting, including Operazione fifa (1956) and Nudi alla meta (1959). Early in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the London West End production of Agatha Christie&apos;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, which went on to become one of the world&apos;s longest-running stage productions. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 and (as of 2007) is still running.In the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such as Ventimila sterline per Amanda (1964) and Cannoni a batasi (1964), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the regimental Sergeant Major. He appeared in the ensemble cast of La grande fuga (1963), as Squadron Leader &quot;Roger Bartlett&quot; (&quot;Big X&quot;), the head of the escape committee.In 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back Golden Globe Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, the first time for Quelli della San Pablo (1966), starring Steve McQueen, and the second time for Il favoloso dottor Dolittle (1967), starring Rex Harrison. He would win another Golden Globe for Best Director, for Gandhi (1982), in 1983. Six years prior to &quot;Gandhi&quot;, he played the ruthless &quot;Gen. Outram&quot; in Indian director Satyajit Ray&apos;s period piece, Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977). He has never been nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category.He took no acting roles following his appearance in Otto Preminger&apos;s Il fattore umano (1979), until his appearance as the eccentric developer &quot;John Hammond&quot; in Steven Spielberg&apos;s Jurassic Park (1993). The following year, he starred as &quot;Kris Kringle&quot; in Miracolo nella 34Âª strada (1994), a remake of the 1947 classic. Since then, he has made occasional appearances in supporting roles, including the historical drama, Elizabeth (1998), as &quot;Sir William Cecil&quot;.In the late 1950s, Attenborough formed a production company, &quot;Beaver Films&quot;, with Bryan Forbes and began to build a profile as a producer on projects, including Un colpo da otto (1960), La tortura del silenzio (1960) and Whistle Down the Wind (1961), also appearing in the first two of these as an actor.His feature film directorial debut was the all-star screen version of the hit musical, Oh che bella guerra! (1969), and his acting appearances became more sporadic - the most notable being his portrayal of serial killer &quot;John Christie&quot; in L&apos;assassino di Rillington Place n. 10 (1971). He later directed two epic period films: Gli anni dell&apos;avventura (1972), based on the early life of Winston Churchill, and Quell&apos;ultimo ponte (1977), an all-star account of Operation Market Garden in World War II. He won the 1982 Academy Award for Directing for his historical epic, Gandhi (1982), a project he had been attempting to get made for many years. As the film&apos;s producer, he also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. His most recent films, as director and producer, include Charlot - Chaplin (1992), starring Robert Downey Jr. as Charles Chaplin, and Viaggio in Inghilterra (1993), based on the relationship between C.S. Lewis and Joy Gresham. Both films starred Anthony Hopkins, who also appeared in three other films for Attenborough: &quot;Young Winston&quot;, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; and the thriller, Magic (1978).Attenborough also directed the screen version of the hit Broadway musical, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; (Chorus Line (1985)), and the apartheid drama, Grido di libertÃ  (1987), based on the experiences of Donald Woods. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director for both films. His most recent film as director was another biographical film, Grey Owl - Gufo grigio (1999), starring Pierce Brosnan.Attenborough is the President of RADA, Chairman of Capital Radio, President of BAFTA, President of the Gandhi Foundation, and President of the British National Film and Television School. He is also a vice patron of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.He is also the patron of the UWC movement (United World Colleges), whereby he continually contributes greatly to the colleges that are part of the organization. He has frequented the United World College of Southern Africa(UWCSA) Waterford Kamhlaba. His wife and he founded the &quot;Richard and Sheila Attenborough Visual Arts Center&quot;. He also founded the &quot;Jane Holland Creative Center for Learning&quot; at Waterford Kamhlaba in Swaziland in memory of his daughter, who died in the Tsunami on Boxing Day, 2004. He passionately believes in education, primarily education that does not judge upon color, race, creed or religion. His attachment to Waterford is his passion for non-racial education, which were the grounds on which Waterford Kamhlaba was founded. Waterford was one of his inspirations for directing Grido di libertÃ  (1987), based on the life of Steve Biko.He was elected to the post of Chancellor of the University of Sussex on 20 March 1998, replacing the Duke of Richmond and Gordon. A lifelong supporter of Chelsea Football Club, Attenborough served as a director of the club from 1969-1982 and, since 1993, has held the honorary position of Life Vice President. He is also the head of the consortium, &quot;Dragon International&quot;, which is constructing a film and television studio complex in Llanilid, Wales, often referred to as &quot;Valleywood&quot;.In 1967, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was knighted in 1976 and, in 1993, he was made a life peer as Baron Attenborough, of Richmond-upon-Thames in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.On 13 July 2006, Attenborough and his brother, David Attenborough, were awarded the titles of Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the University of Leicester &quot;in recognition of a record of continuing distinguished service to the University&quot;. Lord Attenborough is also listed as an Honorary Fellow of Bangor University for his continued efforts to film making.Attenborough has been married to English actress Sheila Sim, since 1945. They had three children. In December 2004, his elder daughter, Jane Holland, as well as her daughter Lucy and her mother-in-law, also named Jane, were killed in the tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. A memorial service was held on 8 March 2005, and Attenborough read a lesson at the national memorial service on 11 May 2005. His grandson, Samuel Holland, and granddaughter, Alice Holland, also read in the service.Attenborough&apos;s father was principal of University College, Leicester, now the city&apos;s university. This has resulted in a long association with the university, with Lord Attenborough a patron. A commemorative plaque was placed on the floor of Richmond Parish Church. The university&apos;s &quot;Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts&quot;, which opened in 1997, is named in his Honor.His son, Michael Attenborough, is also a director. He has two younger brothers, the famous naturalist Sir David Attenborough and John Attenborough, who has made a career in the motor trade.He has collected Pablo Picasso ceramics since the 1950s. More than 100 items went on display at the New Walk Museum and Art Gallery in Leicester in 2007; the exhibition is dedicated to his family members lost in the tsunami.</rdfs:comment>

She returned a few years later to the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm for roles in William Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet and Henrik Ibsen&apos;s A Doll&apos;s House (as Nora).Until then she hadn&apos;t had any bigger experience of television or movies but Ingmar Bergman specifically asked for her to play his mother in the biographical Con le migliori intenzioni (1992) By then her marriage was over and she started a relationship with director Bille August whom she married in 1991 - and had her name changed for the second time. He offered her a role in his La casa degli spiriti (1993), but due to her pregnancy the role went to Winona Ryder instead.She has admirably managed an international career despite having three daughters.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Scott Vincent James Baio was born on September 22, 1960 in Brooklyn, New York. He was the third child of Mario and Rose Baio, who had emigrated from Italy. At the young age of nine, Scott decided that he wanted to be an actor. Soon after, his parents took him on interviews and he was able to land in small roles in commercials. His first real taste of success occurred in 1976 when he beat out 2,000 other child actors for the starring role in the child gangster film Piccoli gangsters (1976). The following year, Scott&apos;s popularity soared after he was chosen for the role of Chachi Arcola, The Fonz&apos;s cousin, on the ABC sitcom Happy Days (1974). Soon after, Scott&apos;s parents moved him to Hollywood to help him keep up with the demands of his acting career. Throughout his stint on Happy Days (1974) from 1977 to 1984, Scott still managed to appear in several films, including Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979), A donne con gli amici (1980) and Zapped! - Il college piÃ¹ sballato d&apos;America (1982) and even starred in three other short-lived sitcoms (Blansky&apos;s Beauties (1977), Attenti ai ragazzi (1978), and the &quot;Happy Days&quot; spin-off Jenny e Chachi (1982)). This exposure helped him become a major teen idol in the early 1980s.After Happy Days (1974) went off the air in 1984, Scott moved to CBS where he was given the starring role on the sitcom Babysitter (1984). He played a college student who was hired to watch over three children. After one season on CBS, the series was retooled and moved to first-run syndication where it ran successfully from 1987 to 1990. Since Babysitter (1984) ended, Scott has been able to stay busy, albeit with a relatively lower profile. He has had starring roles on Baby Talk (1991) and Un detective in corsia (1993) and guest starring roles on L&apos;atelier di Veronica (1997) and Arrested Development - Ti presento i miei (2003). He has even tried his hand behind the camera, directing episodes of The Wayans Bros. (1995) and ...e vissero infelici per sempre (1995).Offscreen, Scott has made a few headlines as well. In 1997, he was rumored to have died in a car accident, but this was quickly declared as false. He has gained a reputation for dating several high-profile (mostly blonde) actresses, most notably Pamela Anderson, Heather Locklear and former co-star Nicole Eggert. In 2007, VH1 played this reputation into a reality series called Scott Baio Is 45... And Single (2007). On the show, he meets with a life coach to try and find reasons why he is still single. In order to accomplish this, he must revisit his ex-girlfriends (including Erin Moran and Julie McCullough) to find out what went right and what went wrong in the relationships. Follwing the completion of the first season, he announced that his girlfriend, Renee Baio, was pregnant with his first child. On November 2, 2007, she gave birth to a baby girl, Bailey Deluca.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alec Baldwin is the oldest, and best-known, of the four Baldwin brothers in the acting business (the others are Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin and Daniel Baldwin). Alexander Rae Baldwin III was born on April 3, 1958 in Massapequa, New York, the son of Carol Newcomb (nee Martineau) Baldwin and Alexander Rae Baldwin Jr., a high school teacher and football coach at Massapequa High School. He is of English, Irish, French, Scottish, and German descent.Alec Baldwin burst onto the TV scene in the early 1980s with appearances on several series, including The Doctors (1963) and California (1979), before scoring feature film roles in Forever, Lulu (1987), Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988), Una donna in carriera (1988), Una vedova allegra... ma non troppo (1988) and Talk Radio (1988). In 1990, Baldwin appeared in the first on-screen adaptation of the &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; character created by mega-selling espionage author, Tom Clancy. The film, Caccia a Ottobre Rosso (1990), was a box office and critical success, with Baldwin appearing alongside icy Sean Connery. Unfortunately, Baldwin fell out with Paramount Studios over future scripts for &quot;Jack Ryan&quot;, and subsequent Ryan roles went to Harrison Ford.Baldwin instead went to Broadway to perform &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, garnering a Tony nomination for his portrayal of &quot;Stanley Kowalski&quot; (he would reprise the role in a 1995 TV adaptation). Baldwin won over critics as a lowlife thief pursued by dogged cop Fred Ward in Miami Blues (1990), met his future wife Kim Basinger while filming the Neil Simon comedy, Bella, bionda... e dice sempre sÃ¬ (1991), starred in the film adaptation of the play, Doppia anima (1992) (in which he starred off-Broadway), and made an indelible ten-minute cameo as a hard-nosed real estate executive laying down the law in Americani (1992). He also made a similar tour-de-force monologue in the thriller, Malice - Il sospetto (1993), as a doctor defending his practices, in which he stated, &quot;Let me tell you something: I am God&quot;.Demand for Baldwin&apos;s talents in the 1990s saw more scripts swiftly come his way, and he starred alongside his then-wife, Kim Basinger, in a remake of the Steve McQueen action flick, Getaway (1994), brought to life the famous comic strip character, L&apos;uomo ombra (1994), and starred as an assistant district attorney in the civil rights drama, L&apos;agguato - Ghosts from the past (1996). Baldwin&apos;s distinctive vocal talents then saw him voice US-aired episodes of the highly popular UK children&apos;s show, Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends (1984), plus later voice-only contributions to other animated/children&apos;s shows, including Clerks (2000), Come cani &amp; gatti (2001), Final Fantasy (2001) and SpongeBob - Il film (2004).In the early 2000s, Baldwin and Basinger endured an acrimonious break-up that quickly became tabloid fodder but, while his divorce was high-profile, Baldwin excelled in a number of lower-profile supporting roles in a variety of films, including Hollywood, Vermont (2000), Pearl Harbor (2001), The Cooler (2003) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor), The Aviator (2004), ...E alla fine arriva Polly (2004) and The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006). As he was excelling as a consummate character actor, Baldwin found a second career in television comedy. Already known for his comedic turns hosting Il Saturday Night Live (1975), he essayed an extended guest role on Will &amp; Grace (1998) in 2005 before taking on what would arguably become his most famous role, that of network executive &quot;Jack Donaghy&quot;, opposite Tina Fey in the highly-acclaimed sitcom, 30 Rock (2006). The role brought Baldwin two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, and an unprecedented six Screen Actors Guild Awards (not including cast wins).Continuing to appear in films as 30 Rock (2006) wrapped up its final season, Baldwin was engaged in 2012 to wed Hilaria Baldwin (aka Hilaria Lynn Thomas); the couple married on June 30, 2012.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasName rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Christian Bale</ActorOntology:hasName>
        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1974-01-30</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Christian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer &quot;Jenny&quot; (James) and David Bale. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale&apos;s childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in &quot;The Nerd&quot;. A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia - L&apos;ultima dei Romanov (1986) caught Steven Spielberg&apos;s eye, leading to Bale&apos;s well-documented role in L&apos;impero del sole (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh&apos;s 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s Enrico V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of L&apos;isola del tesoro (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Gli strilloni (1992), Swing Kids - Giovani ribelli (1993), Piccole donne (1994), Ritratto di signora (1996), L&apos;agente segreto (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and Sogno di una notte di mezza estate (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron&apos;s adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; crowned Bale one of the &quot;Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures&quot; of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the &quot;Most Creative People in Entertainment&quot;, and &quot;Premiere&quot; lauded him as one of the &quot;Hottest Leading Men Under 30&quot;.Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Il mandolino del capitano Corelli (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Il regno del fuoco (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and L&apos;uomo senza sonno (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale&apos;s physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale&apos;s abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan&apos;s definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman &amp; Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman&apos;s phenomenal success: The New World - Il nuovo mondo (2005) and Harsh Times - I giorni dell&apos;odio (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006&apos;s L&apos;alba della libertÃ  (2006), Werner Herzog&apos;s feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in The Prestige (2006), the remake of Quel treno per Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, Io non sono qui (2007).Anticipation for Il cavaliere oscuro (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale&apos;s graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale&apos;s next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator Salvation (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann&apos;s Nemico pubblico - Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)&apos;s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer &quot;Irish&quot; Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic I fiori della guerra (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Il cavaliere oscuro - Il ritorno (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Il fuoco della vendetta - Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle - L&apos;apparenza inganna (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with The New World - Il nuovo mondo (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Offbeat, unconventionally pretty, and utterly mesmerizing, Ellen Barkin was born on April 16, 1954 in the Bronx, New York, to Evelyn (Rozin), a hospital administrator, and Sol Barkin, a chemical salesman. Her parents were both from Russian Jewish families. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan&apos;s High School of the Performing Arts.Barkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love: acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York&apos;s Actor&apos;s Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays &quot;Shout Across the River&quot; (1979), &quot;Extremities&quot; (1983), &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1984) and &quot;Eden Court&quot; (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in A cena con gli amici (1982) opposite Mickey Rourke and Daniel Stern, and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in The Big Easy (1986) starring Dennis Quaid and Siesta (1987) with Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.With trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite Al Pacino in the thriller Seduzione pericolosa (1989). In addition, she was well cast as Robert De Niro&apos;s abused wife in Voglia di ricominciare (1993), and portrayed &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; in Wild Bill (1995) with earnest. Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in Paura e delirio a Las Vegas (1998), Bella da morire (1999) and Mercy (Senza pietÃ ) (2000). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie La contropartita (1988) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in Le ali per volare (1997) opposite Oprah Winfrey as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.In 2000, Barkin married billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like Lei mi odia (2004) and Palindromes (2004). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.Just prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother George Barkin, who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive Caroline Kaplan. In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007) with George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean&apos;s with a supporting role in Antoine Fuqua&apos;s Brooklyn&apos;s Finest (2009), Happy Tears (2009) with Parker Posey and Demi Moore, and Twelve (2010).Barkin has produced features over time, including Letters to Juliet (2010) and Another Happy Day (2011) (she also starred in the latter project). On the small screen, she appeared in an episode of Modern Family (2009) and her new NBC show, The New Normal (2012), got a sneak peek during the Olympics.More recent sightings have included the films The Chameleon (2010), Very Good Girls (2013), Mr Cobbler e la bottega magica (2014), Hands of Stone (2016) and Active Adults (2017). She has had regular roles on the TV series The New Normal (2012) and Animal Kingdom (2016).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1933-11-03</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Barry was born in York, England in 1933, and was the youngest of three children. His father, Jack, owned several local cinemas and by the age of fourteen, Barry was capable of running the projection box on his own - in particular, The Rialto in York. As he was brought up in a cinematic environment, he soon began to assimilate the music which accompanied the films he saw nightly to a point when, even before he&apos;d left St. Peters school, he had decided to become a film music composer. Helped by lessons provided locally on piano and trumpet, followed by the more exacting theory taught by tutors as diverse as Dr Francis Jackson of York Minster and William Russo, formerly arranger to Stan Kenton and His Orchestra, he soon became equipped to embark upon his chosen career, but had no knowledge of how one actually got a start in the business. A three year sojourn in the army as a bandsman combined with his evening stints with local jazz bands gave him the idea to ease this passage by forming a small band of his own. This was how The John Barry Seven came into existence, and Barry successfully launched them during 1957 via a succession of tours and TV appearances. A recording contract with EMI soon followed, and although initial releases made by them failed to chart, Barry&apos;s undoubted talent showed enough promise to influence the studio management at Abbey Road in allowing him to make his debut as an arranger and conductor for other artists on the EMI roster.A chance meeting with a young singer named Adam Faith, whilst both were appearing on astage show version of the innovative BBC TV programme, Six-Five Special (1957), led Barry to recommend Faith for a later BBC TV series, Drumbeat (1959), which was broadcast in 1959. Faith had made two or three commercially unsuccessful records before singer/songwriter Johnny Worth, also appearing on Drumbeat, offered him a song he&apos;d just finished entitled What Do You Want? With the assistance of the JB7 pianist, Les Reed, Barry contrived an arrangement considered suited to Faith&apos;s soft vocal delivery, and within weeks, the record was number one. Barry (and Faith) then went from strength to strength; Faith achieving a swift succession of chart hits, with Barry joining him soon afterwards when the Seven, riding high on the wave of the early sixties instrumental boom, scored with Hit &amp; Miss, Walk Don&apos;t Run and Black Stockings.Faith had long harboured ambitions to act even before his first hit record and was offered a part in the up and coming British movie, Beat Girl (1960), at that time. As Barry was by then arranging not only his recordings but also his live Drumbeat material, it came as no surprise when the film company asked him to write the score to accompany Faith&apos;s big screen debut. It should be emphasised that the film was hardly a cinematic masterpiece. However, it did give Faith a chance to demonstrate his acting potential, and Barry the chance to show just how quickly he&apos;d mastered the technique of film music writing. Although the film and soundtrack album were both commercial successes, further film score offers failed to flood in. On those that did, such as I gangsters di Piccadilly (1960) and Gli ospiti di mia moglie (1962), Barry proved highly inventive, diverse and adaptable and, as a result, built up a reputation as an emerging talent. It was with this in mind that Noel Rogers, of United Artists Music, approached him in the summer of &apos;62, with a view to involving him in the music for the forthcoming James Bond film, Agente 007 - Licenza di uccidere (1962).He was also assisted onto the cinematic ladder as a result of a burgeoning relationship with actor/writer turned director Bryan Forbes, who asked him to write a couple of jazz numbers for use in a club scene in Forbes&apos; then latest film, La stanza a forma di L (1962). From this very modest beginning, the couple went on to collaborate on five subsequent films, including the highly acclaimed Ventimila sterline per Amanda (1964), Qualcuno da odiare (1965) and Bisbigli (1967). Other highlights from the sixties included five more Bond films, Zulu (1964), Nata libera (1966) (a double Oscar), Il leone d&apos;inverno (1968) (another Oscar) and Un uomo da marciapiede (1969).In the seventies he scored the cult film L&apos;inizio del cammino (1971), L&apos;ultima valle (1971), Maria Stuarda regina di Scozia (1971) (Oscar nomination), wrote the theme for Attenti a quei due (1971), a musical version of Alice&apos;s Adventures In Wonderland and the hit musical Billy. Then, in 1974, he made the decision to leave his Thameside penthouse apartment for the peace of a remote villa he was having built in Majorca. He had been living there for about a year, during which time he turned down all film scoring opportunities, until he received an invitation to write the score for the American TV movie, Eleanor and Franklin (1976). In order to accomplish the task, he booked into the Beverly Hills Hotel for six weeks in October 1975. However, during this period, he was also offered Robin e Marian (1976) and King Kong (1976), which caused his stay to be extended. He was eventually to live and work in the hotel for almost a year, as more assignments were offered and accepted. His stay on America&apos;s West Coast eventually lasted almost five years, during which time he met and married his wife, Laurie, who lived with him at his Beverly Hills residence. They moved to Oyster Bay, New York and have since split their time between there and a house in Cadogan Square, London.After adopting a seemingly lower profile towards the end of the seventies, largely due to the relatively obscure nature of the commissions he accepted, the eighties saw John Barry re-emerge once more into the cinematic limelight. This was achieved, not only by continuing to experiment and diversify, but also by mixing larger budget commissions of the calibre of Brivido caldo (1981), Doppio taglio (1985), La mia Africa (1985) (another Oscar) and Cotton Club (1984) with smaller ones such as the TV movies, Touched by Love (1980) and La ragazza e il professore (1983). Other successes included: Somewhere in Time (1980), Frances (1982), three more Bond films, and Peggy Sue si Ã¨ sposata (1986).After serious illness in the late eighties, Barry returned with yet another Oscar success with Balla coi lupi (1990) and was also nominated for Charlot - Chaplin (1992). Since then he scored the controversial Proposta indecente (1993), My Life - Questa mia vita (1993), Ruby Cairo (1992), Terra amata (1995) and has made compilation albums for Sony (Moviola and Moviola II) and non-soundtrack albums for Decca (&apos;The Beyondness Of Things&apos; &amp; &apos;Eternal Echoes&apos;).In the late nineties he made a staggeringly successful return to the concert arena, playing to sell-out audiences at the Royal Albert Hall. Since then he has appeared as a guest conductor at a RAH concert celebrating the life and career of Elizabeth Taylor and made brief appearances at a couple of London concerts dedicated to his music. In 2004 he re-united with Don Black to write his fifth stage musical, Brighton Rock, which enjoyed a limited run at The Almeida Theatre in London.He continued to appear at concerts of his own music, often making brief appearances at the podium. In November 2007, Christine Albanel, the French Minister for Culture, appointed him Commander in the National Order of Arts and Letters. The award was made at the eighth International Festival Music and Cinema, in Auxerre, France, when, in his honour, a concert of his music also took place.In August 2008 he was working on a new album, provisionally entitled Seasons, which he has described as &quot;a soundtrack of his life.&quot; A new biography, &quot;John Barry: The Man with The Midas Touch&quot;, by Geoff Leonard, Pete Walker, and Gareth Bramley, was published in November 2008.He died following a heart-attack on 30th January 2011, at his home in Oyster Bay, New York.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Captivating, gifted, and sensational, Angela Bassett&apos;s presence has been felt in theaters and on stages and television screens throughout the world. Angela Evelyn Bassett was born on August 16, 1958 in New York City, to Betty Jane (Gilbert), a social worker, and Daniel Benjamin Bassett, a preacher&apos;s son. Bassett and her sister D&apos;nette grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida with their mother. As a single mother, Betty stressed the importance of education for her children. With the assistance of an academic scholarship, Bassett matriculated into Yale University. In 1980, she received her B.A. in African-American studies from Yale University. In 1983, she earned a Master of Fine Arts Degree from the Yale School of Drama. It was at Yale that Bassett met her husband, Courtney B. Vance, a 1986 graduate of the Drama School.Bassett first appeared in small roles on I Robinson (1984) and Spenser (1985), but it was not until 1990 that a spate of television roles brought her notice. Her breakthrough role, though, was playing Tina Turner, whom she had never seen perform before taking the role, in Tina - What&apos;s Love Got to Do with It (1993). Bassett&apos;s performance earned her an Academy Award nomination and a Golded Globe Award for Best Actress.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sean Bean&apos;s career since the eighties spans theatre, radio, television and movies. Bean was born in Handsworth, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, to Rita (Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He worked for his father&apos;s welding firm before he decided to become an actor. He attended RADA in London and appeared in a number of West End stage productions including RSC&apos;s &quot;Fair Maid of the West&quot; (Spencer), (1986) and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1987) (Romeo) , as well as &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (Lederer) (1985) at the Young Vic and &quot;Killing the Cat&quot; (Danny) (1990) at the Theatre Upstairs.This soulful, green-eyed blonde&apos;s roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villains, as in Clarissa (1991), passionate lovers like Mellors in Lady Chatterley (1993), rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heart wrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in Troy (2004), where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie. Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Macbeth,&quot; where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed. Bean, however, remains himself, a man&apos;s man, and in the glitzy world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint.Bean has three daughters, Lorna, Molly and Evie.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Kate Beckinsale was born on 26 July 1973 in Hounslow, Middlesex, England, and has resided in London for most of her life. Her mother is Judy Loe, who has appeared in a number of British dramas and sitcoms and continues to work as an actress, predominantly in British television productions. Her father was Richard Beckinsale, born in Nottingham, England. He starred in a number of popular British television comedies during the 1970s, most notably the series Rising Damp (1974), Porridge (1974) and The Lovers (1970). He passed away tragically early in 1979 at the age of 31.Kate attended the private school Godolphin and Latymer School in London for her grade and primary school education. In her teens she twice won the British bookseller W.H. Smith Young Writers&apos; competition - once for three short stories and once for three poems. After a tumultuous adolescence (a bout of anorexia - cured - and a smoking habit which continues to this day), she gradually took up the profession of acting.Her major acting debut came in a TV film about World War II called One Against the Wind (1991), filmed in Luxembourg during the summer of 1991. It first aired on American television that December. Kate began attending Oxford University&apos;s New College in the fall of 1991, majoring in French and Russian literature. She had already decided that she wanted to act, but to broaden her horizons she chose university over drama school. While in her first year at Oxford, Kate received her big break in Kenneth Branagh&apos;s film adaptation of William Shakespeare&apos;s Molto rumore per nulla (1993). Kate worked in three other films while attending Oxford, beginning with a part in the medieval historical drama Prince of Jutland (1994), cast as Ethel. The film was shot during the spring of 1993 on location in Denmark, and she filmed her supporting part during New College&apos;s Easter break. Later in the summer of that year she played the lead in the contemporary mystery drama Scacco matto (1994). Before she went back to school, her third year at university was spent at Oxford&apos;s study-abroad program in Paris, France, immersing herself in the French language, Parisian culture and French cigarettes.A year away from the academic community and living on her own in the French capital caused her to re-evaluate the direction of her life. She faced a choice: continue with school or concentrate on her flourishing acting career. After much thought, she chose the acting career. In the spring of 1994 Kate left Oxford, after finishing three years of study. Kate appeared in the BBC/Thames Television satire Cold Comfort Farm (1995), filmed in London and East Sussex during late summer 1994 and which opened to spectacular reviews in the United States, grossing over $5 million during its American run. It was re-released to U.K. theaters in the spring of 1997.Acting on the stage consumed the first part of 1995; she toured in England with the Thelma Holts Theatre Company production of Anton Chekhov&apos;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;. After turning down several mediocre scripts &quot;and going nearly berserk with boredom&quot;, she waited seven months before another interesting role was offered to her. Her big movie of 1995 was the romance/horror movie Fantasmi (1995), starring opposite Aidan Quinn and John Gielgud, and filmed in West Sussex. In this film she wanted to play &quot;an object of desire&quot;, unlike her past performances where her characters were much less the siren and more the worldly innocent. Kate&apos;s first film project of 1996 was the British ITV production of Jane Austen&apos;s novel Emma (1996). Her last film of 1996 was the comedy Big Fish (1997), filmed at Shepperton Studios in London during early fall. She played the part of Georgie, an altruistic con artist. She had a daughter, Lily, in 1999 with actor Michael Sheen.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One cool, eternally classy lady, Candice Bergen was elegantly poised for trendy &quot;ice princess&quot; stardom when she first arrived on the &apos;60s screen, but she gradually reshaped that dÃ©butante image in the &apos;70s, both on- and off-camera. A staunch, outspoken feminist with a decisive edge, she went on to take a sizable portion of those contradicting qualities to film and, most particularly, to late 1980s TV.The daughter of famed ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and former actress and &quot;Chesterfield Girl&quot; model Frances Bergen (nÃ©e Westerman), Candice Patricia Bergen was born in Beverly Hills, California, of Swedish, German, and English descent. At the age of six, she made her radio debut on her father&apos;s show. She attended Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles, the Cathedral School in Washington D.C. and then went abroad to the Montesano (finishing) School in Switzerland. Although she began taking art history and creative drawing at the University of Pennsylvania, she did not complete her studies.In between she also worked as a Ford model in order to buy cameras for her new passion--photography. Her Grace Kelly-like glacial beauty deemed her an ideal candidate for Ivy League patrician roles, and Candice made an auspicious film debut while still a college student portraying the Vassar-styled lesbian member of Sidney Lumet&apos;s Il gruppo (1966) in an ensemble that included the debuts of other lovely up-and-comers including Kathleen Widdoes, Carrie Nye, Joan Hackett and Joanna Pettet.Film offers started coming her way, both here and abroad (spurred by her love for travel). Other than her top-notch roles as the co-ed who comes between Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel in Conoscenza carnale (1971) and her prim American lady kidnapped by Moroccan sheik Sean Connery in Il vento e il leone (1975), her performances were deemed a bit too aloof to really stand out among the crowd. During this time, she found a passionate second career as a photographer and photojournalist. A number of her works went on to appear in an assortment of magazines including Life, Playboy and Esquire.Most of Candice&apos;s 1970s films were dismissible and unworthy of her talents, including the campus comedy L&apos;impossibilitÃ  di essere normale (1970) opposite the hip counterculture star of the era -- Elliott Gould; the disturbingly violent Soldato blu (1970); the epic-sized bomb L&apos;ultimo avventuriero (1970); Appuntamento con una ragazza che si sente sola (1971); Stringi i denti e vai! (1975); Il principio del domino: la vita in gioco (1977), Lina WertmÃ¼ller&apos;s long-winded and notoriously long-titled Italian drama La fine del mondo nel nostro solito letto in una notte piena di pioggia (1978); and the inferior sequel to the huge box-office soaper Love Story (1970), entitled Oliver&apos;s Story (1978) alongside original star Ryan O&apos;Neal. Things picked up toward the second half of the decade, however, when the seemingly humorless Candice made a clever swipe at comedy. She made history as the first female guest host of Il Saturday Night Live (1975) and then showed an equally amusing side of her in the dramedy E ora: punto e a capo (1979) as Burt Reynolds&apos; tone-deaf ex-wife, enjoying a &quot;best supporting actress&quot; Oscar nomination in the process. She and Jacqueline Bisset also worked well as a team in George Cukor&apos;s Ricche e famose (1981), in which her mother Frances could be glimpsed in a Malibu party scene.Candice made her Broadway debut in 1985 replacing Sigourney Weaver in David Rabe&apos;s black comedy &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;. In 1980 Candice married Louis Malle, the older (by 14 years) French director. They had one child, Chloe. In the late 1980s, Candice hit a new career plateau on comedy television as the spiky title role on Murphy Brown (1988), giving great gripe as the cynical and competitive anchor/reporter of a TV magazine show. With a superlative supporting cast around her, the CBS sitcom went the distance (ten seasons) and earned Candice a whopping five Emmys and two Golden Globe awards. TV-movie roles also came her way as a result with colorful roles ranging from the evil Arthurian temptress &quot;Morgan Le Fey&quot; to an elite, high-classed madam -- all many moons away from her initial white-gloved debs of the late 60s.Husband Malle&apos;s illness and subsequent death from cancer in 1995 resulted in Candice maintaining a low profile for an extended period. In time, however, she married a second time (since 2000) to Manhattan real estate developer Marshall Rose and returned to acting with a renewed vigor (or vinegar), with many of her characters enjoyable extensions of her sardonic &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; character. As for TV, she joined the 2005 cast of Boston Legal (2004) playing a brash, no-nonsense lawyer while trading barbs with a much less serious William Shatner, earning an Emmy nomination in the process. In 2018, Candice revisited her Murphy Brown character in a revised series form with many of the cast back on board. The show, however, was cancelled after only one season.Candice also ventured into the romantic comedy film genre with a spray of crisp supports -- sometimes as a confidante, sometimes as a villain. Such films include Miss Detective (2000), Tutta colpa dell&apos;amore - Sweet home Alabama (2002), Matrimonio impossibile (2003), Sex and the City (2008), The Women (2008), Bride Wars - La mia migliore nemica (2009), Natale con i tuoi (2014), L&apos;eccezione alla regola (2016), The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) (2017), 40 sono i nuovi 20 (2017) and Book Club - Tutto puÃ² succedere (2018).</rdfs:comment>

He hit the big-time when he was cast as Kyle Reese, the man sent back through time to stop Arnold Schwarzenegger in James Cameron&apos;s Terminator (1984). This established a good working relationship with Cameron, a relationship that should have catapulted Biehn to international stardom. He starred in Cameron&apos;s subsequent films, Aliens - Scontro finale (1986) and The Abyss (1989), the latter a standout performance as unstable Navy SEAL officer Lt. Hiram Coffey. In the 1990s he starred in films like Navy Seals - Pagati per morire (1990), K2 - L&apos;ultima sfida (1991) and was particularly memorable as Johnny Ringo in Tombstone (1993). Biehn is married and the father of four sons.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Juliette Binoche was born in Paris, France, to Monique Yvette Stalens, a director, teacher, and actress, and Jean-Marie Binoche, a sculptor, director, and actor. Her mother was born in Czestochowa, Poland, of French, Walloon Belgian, and Polish descent, while her father is French. Juliette was only 23 when she first attracted the attention of international film critics with L&apos;insostenibile leggerezza dell&apos;essere (1988). Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times film critic with an international following of his books on film and TV reviews, wrote that she was &quot;almost ethereal in her beauty and innocence&quot;. That innocence was gone by the time Binoche completed Louis Malle&apos;s Il danno (1992) (aka &quot;Fatale&quot;). In an interview after the film was released, Binoche said: &quot;Malle was trying direct and wanted something more sophisticated&quot;. A year later, Krzysztof Kieslowski&apos;s Tre colori - Film blu (1993) was added to her film credits. After a sabbatical from film-making to become a mother in 1994, Binoche was selected as the heroine of France&apos;s most expensive ($35 million) movie ever: L&apos;ussaro sul tetto (1995). More recently, she has made Il paziente inglese (1996), for which she won an Oscar for &apos;Best supporting actress&apos; and Chocolat (2000).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">For some people, oatmeal starts the day off right - for Thora Birch, it launched a healthy career in front of the camera. It&apos;s hard to believe that the actress, who slunk into stardom with her turn as the disillusioned daughter in American Beauty (1999), is even related to the apple-cheeked blonde who once gazed up at Quaker Oats (R) spokesman Wilford Brimley and said, &quot;Mmm-hmm. Yeah, grandpa&quot;, but Birch still remembers the professional advice Brimley whispered in her ear: maintain eye contact and *really* listen. Since then, she&apos;s had ample opportunity to study some of Hollywood&apos;s top talents at work - in addition to her American Beauty (1999) scenes with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, she&apos;s acted alongside Harrison Ford, Harvey Keitel and Jeremy Irons. Named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder, Thora was born in Los Angeles to Jack Birch and Carol Connors Birch (they kept up the tempestuous theme by naming her younger brother Bolt Birch). By age 4, she was a regular at commercial auditions and, by age 6, she&apos;d landed a spot on the short-lived daycare sitcom Day by Day (1988). Her film career got off to an auspicious start that same year, when she won a Young Artist Award for her debut opposite Neil Patrick Harris in the children&apos;s fantasy flick Amico venuto dallo spazio (1988). After a short break, she picked up a role in another fleeting sitcom, Fra nonni e nipoti (1990) (based on the movie of the same name). By age 9, Birch had her life pretty much figured out - she told the L.A. Times that she planned to become a director by 24, then spend a year ice skating, then spend a year as a policewoman, and, finally, become a singer. She picked up her last name (early appearances credited her as just &quot;Thora&quot;) and returned to the big screen as Elijah Wood&apos;s tomboy friend in La strada per il paradiso (1991). She then scored a high-profile supporting role as Harrison Ford&apos;s daughter in Giochi di potere (1992), which she reprised in Sotto il segno del pericolo (1994). In between, she kept busy with family films Hocus Pocus (1993) and Il mio amico zampalesta (1994). In 1995, Birch graduated into adolescent territory with her turn as a younger Melanie Griffith in Amiche per sempre (1995). She followed that up with a top-billed role in the snowy adventure Alaska (1996), then took a three-year hiatus from acting. She resurfaced in 1999, first in the made-for-TV Un nuovo inizio (1999) and then, more visibly, in American Beauty (1999). Birch had heard about &quot;Beauty&quot; through the industry grapevine, and she immediately set her sights on the part of &quot;Jane Burnham&quot;. As it turned out, she was the first to audition for director Sam Mendes; while he saw dozens of other actresses for the role, none delivered a more convincing &quot;Jane&quot;. Still reeling from her sudden celebrity status, Birch plucked a handful of diverse projects from the deluge of post-&quot;Beauty&quot; scripts. Seeking an even edgier adolescent role, she appeared as a punk-rocker in the indie film The Smokers (2000), then dropped the tough-girl pose to play the gentle &quot;Empress Savina&quot; in the live-action adaptation of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2000). She also signed up to play a teen hipster caught up in a post-high school identity crisis in Ghost World (2001) (based on the graphic novel), and an English schoolgirl in the thriller The Hole (2001). Style-conscious and sophisticated beyond her years, Birch lives on her family&apos;s East L.A. ranch (where she recently finished high school through a computer-based correspondence course). She still hopes to try her hand at directing someday, but, for now, she&apos;s content to continue blossoming in front of the camera.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1944-09-13</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jacqueline Bisset has been an international film star since the late 1960s. She received her first roles mainly because of her stunning beauty, but over time she has become a fine actress respected by fans and critics alike. Bisset has worked with directors John Huston, FranÃ§ois Truffaut, George Cukor and Roman Polanski. Her co-stars have included Anthony Quinn, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Kenneth Branagh and Marcello Mastroianni.She was brought up in England and had to study to learn French. Her mother was French and was an attorney before being married. As a child Jacqueline studied ballet. During her teenage years her father left the family when her mother was diagnosed with disseminating sclerosis; Jacqueline worked as a model to support her ailing mother and eventually her parents divorced, an experience she has said she considered character-strengthening. She took an early interest in film, and her modeling career helped pay for acting lessons. In 1967, Bisset gained her first critical attention in Due per la strada (1967), and in that same year appeared briefly in the popular James Bond spoof James Bond 007 - Casino Royale (1967), playing Miss Goodthighs.In 1968 her career got a boost when Mia Farrow unexpectedly dropped out of the shooting of Inchiesta pericolosa (1968); Farrow&apos;s marriage to co-star Frank Sinatra was on the rocks, and her role was eventually given to Bisset, who received special billing in the film&apos;s credits. That same year she earned a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcomer for L&apos;onda lunga (1968) and gained even more attention playing opposite Steve McQueen in the popular action film Bullitt (1968). In 1970 she was featured in the star-studded disaster film Airport (1970) and had the starring role in La cavalletta (1970). Then she co-starred with Alan Alda in the well-reviewed but commercially underperforming horror movie, La macchia della morte (1971). In 1973, she became recognized in Europe as a serious dramatic actress when she played the lead in Effetto notte (1973). However, it would be several years before her talents would be taken seriously in the U.S. Although she scored another domestic hit with Assassinio sull&apos;Orient Express (1974), her part in it, as had often been the case, was decorative. She did appear to good effect in Il ladro che venne a pranzo (1973), Come si distrugge la reputazione del piÃ¹ grande agente segreto del mondo (1973), La donna della domenica (1975) and Candidato all&apos;obitorio (1976).Bisset&apos;s looks and figure made quite a splash in Abissi (1977). Her underwater swimming scenes in that movie inspired the worldwide wet T-shirt craze, and Newsweek magazine declared her &quot;the most beautiful film actress of all time&quot;. The film&apos;s producer, Peter Guber, said &quot;That T-shirt made me a rich man.&quot; However, she hated the wet T-shirt scenes because she felt exploited. At the time of filming she was not told that the filmmakers would shoot the scenes in such a provocative way, and she felt tricked. Nevertheless, the huge success of the picture made Bisset officially bankable. She was next seen in high-profile roles in Il magnate greco (1978), a thinly disguised fictionalization of the marriage of Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, and Qualcuno sta uccidendo i piÃ¹ grandi cuochi d&apos;Europa (1978), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress in a Comedy.In the early 1980s, Bisset starred in the box office disasters Ormai non c&apos;Ã¨ piÃ¹ scampo (1980) and Inchon (1981), but her well-received turn opposite Candice Bergen in Ricche e famose (1981) in between those two films gained her recognition as a serious actress from American audiences. She rebounded neatly with Class (1983), playing Rob Lowe&apos;s attractive mother who has an affair with her son&apos;s prep school roommate, and as Albert Finney&apos;s wife in Sotto il vulcano (1984), a part that earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also earned praise for her work in the cable adaptation of Anna Karenina (1985) with Christopher Reeve, and in the miniseries Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story (1987) with Armand Assante. In 1989 she co-starred in the racy comedy Scene di lotta di classe a Beverly Hills (1989) and the controversial erotic thriller Orchidea selvaggia (1989), neither of which fared well critically or financially, but her output remained consistent in the &apos;90s with television projects and independent features.In 1996, she was nominated for a CÃ©sar Award, the French equivalent of the Oscar, for her performance in Claude Chabrol&apos;s Il buio nella mente (1995). She held roles in period productions like Padrona del suo destino (1998), as a retired courtesan in 16th-century Venice, and the Biblical epics GesÃ¹ (1999) and In the beginning - In principio era (2000), playing the Virgin Mary and Sarah, wife of Abraham, respectively. Other notable credits included the miniseries Joan of Arc (1999) alongside Leelee Sobieski, which gained her an Emmy nomination, and The Sleepy Time Gal (2001), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival but, unfortunately, was not picked up for theatrical distribution. In 2005 Jacqueline was back on the big screen, playing Keira Knightley&apos;s mother in the Domino Harvey biopic Domino (2005) for Tony Scott. In 2006, she appeared in the fourth season of the FX series Nip/Tuck (2003) as the ruthless extortionist &quot;James.&quot; More recently she appeared in BBC&apos;s program Dancing on the Edge (2013), for which she finally won her first Golden Globe Award, and in the movies Welcome to New York (2014) with GÃ©rard Depardieu and Miss You Already (2015) with Drew Barrymore and Toni Collette.Bisset has never married, but has been involved in long-term romantic relationships with Canadian actor Michael Sarrazin, Moroccan entrepreneur Victor Drai, Russian ballet dancer Alexander Godunov, Swiss actor Vincent Perez and Turkish martial arts instructor Emin Boztepe. She continues to make numerous films, and frequently participates in film festivals and award ceremonies around the world.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1925-08-22</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Comparing this sultry-eyed blonde to Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich may seem a bit overzealous, but Honor Blackman&apos;s stylish allure cannot be denied.One of four children, Blackman was born in London&apos;s East End, to Edith Eliza (Stokes), a homemaker, and Frederick Thomas Blackman, a statistician employed with the civil service. She received diction lessons as a teenager and later attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She temporarily followed in her father&apos;s footsteps with a job in the civil service, and then was, of all things, a dispatch rider during World War II. This is where she developed some of her trademark athleticism.Blackman received her first acting work on stage in London&apos;s West End as an understudy for &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot;. She continued with roles n &quot;The Gleam&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Blind Goddess&quot; (1947), before moving into film. She debuted with Fame Is the Spur (1947), starring Michael Redgrave. In that picture, Blackman dies from a horse-riding accident. This film established the strange pattern wherein many of her movie characters meet untimely deaths. Signed up with the Rank Organisation, Blackman joined several other starlet hopefuls who were being groomed for greater fame. She was initially cast as demure, pleasant young things or &quot;English Rose&quot; types and received dependable but unmemorable costar billing in films such as Daughter of Darkness (1948) (1948), Passioni (1948), A Boy, a Girl and a Bike (1949) (1949), Tragica incertezza (1950) (1950) and La quinta offensiva (1951) (1951), the last starring a young Richard Burton. Hollywood also took brief notice when she was cast as the second lead femme in MGM&apos;s Alto tradimento (1949) (1949), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Taylor.The stress and struggles of advancing her career coupled with a divorce from her first husband, Bill Sankey, caused Blackman to suffer a nervous collapse in the mid-1950s. After a brief time recovering in a hospital, she regained her health and began rebuilding her career with rather obligatory B-level fare, at first. That reentry culminated with a costarring role in one of the more famous retellings of the tragic &quot;Titanic&quot; tale, Titanic: Latitudine 41Â° Nord (1958) (1958), costarring Kenneth More and David McCallum. Developing a solid footing again, she filmed Io e il generale (1958) (1959) with comedian Norman Wisdom and Il mistero del signor Cooper (1961) (1961) with Terry-Thomas.TV series work then also came her way, notably with the highly popular Agente speciale (1961), co-starring Patrick Macnee as John Steed. As the leather-clad &quot;Mrs. Cathy Gale&quot;, Blackman showcased her incredible beauty, self-confidence, and athletic derring-do. Her admirable qualities made her not only a catch for the men, but also an inspirational figure for the 1960s feminist movement. Blackman left the show at its peak, however, and was replaced by the equally assertive and popular Diana Rigg as Mrs. Emma Peel.Not out of work long, Blackman took on the role of Greek goddess Hera in popular movie adventure Gli Argonauti (1963) (1963) with marvelous Ray Harryhausen and melodrama Flagrante adulterio (1965) (1965) with Laurence Harvey. She then filmed the most popular role of her career: &quot;Pussy Galore&quot;. In the classic &quot;James Bond&quot; movie Agente 007 - Missione Goldfinger (1964) (1964), Blackman went toe to toe with Sean Connery&apos;s womanizing &quot;007&quot; and created major sparks on screen, managing to outclass the (wink-wink) double meaning of her character&apos;s name.That resurgence of popularity should have led to better film opportunities but did not. Blackman toiled for the most part in low-level melodramas and routine actioneers, including the western Shalako (1968); the adventure La calata dei barbari (1968); the romantic drama La vergine e lo zingaro (1970); the horror opus Una figlia per il diavolo (1976); and the whodunnit mystery Il gatto e il canarino (1978).A different story on the theatrical front where she earned raves on stage as the blind heroine of the thriller &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; as well as for her dual roles in &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot;, a production based on two of NoÃ«l Coward&apos;s plays. She also enjoyed working occasionally with her second husband, actor Maurice Kaufmann, in the play &quot;Move Over, Mrs. Markham&quot; and the film thriller L&apos;allucinante notte di una baby sitter (1971) with Susan George. She proved a throaty-voiced sensation in various musicals productions as well, such as &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;On Your Toes&quot;, and &quot;Nunsense.&quot;Into the millennium, Honor was seen in such films as Il diario di Bridget Jones (2001), Colour Me Kubrick: A True...ish Story (2005), Reuniting the Rubins (2010), I, Anna (2012) and London Zombies (2012), as well as the British TV series &quot;Midsomer Murders,&quot; &quot;The Royal,&quot; &quot;Coronation Street,&quot; &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;You, Me &amp; Them.&quot;Divorced from Kaufmann in 1975 (he died in 1997), Blackman never remarried. The couple adopted two children in the late 1960s, Lottie and Barnaby. At octogenarian age, the ever-lovely and still glamorous star performed frequently, working in the long-running English hit comedy series The Upper Hand (1990) and in her one-woman stage show, &quot;Wayward Ladies.&quot;Honor Blackman died on April 5, 2020, in Lewes, Sussex. She was 94.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">From the age of five, Linda Blair had to get used to the spotlight, first as a child model and then as an actress, when out of 600 applicants she was picked for the role of Regan, the possessed child, in L&apos;esorcista (1973). Linda quickly rose to international fame, won the Golden Globe, and seemed to be set to take the Academy Award for that role, but when it leaked how some parts of the role were not performed by her (the demonic voice was dubbed by Mercedes McCambridge, and eight seconds of a stunt dummy were used) that dream broke, and with that disappointment probably came the first blow to what looked like the beginning of an A-list career.Over the next few years she had no trouble securing lead roles in a number of pictures, including the highly successful television films La ragazza del riformatorio (1974) (the #1 TV movie of that year) and Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic (1975), as well as the Exorcist sequel L&apos;esorcista II - L&apos;eretico (1977). However, when she was peer pressured into buying cocaine at the age of 18, it led to an arrest and subsequent sentencing to three years probation. The much-publicized drug bust caused Linda to be blacklisted in Hollywood, and her career was soon reduced to B-movies and occasional TV guest appearances only.Although her career never returned to its former glory, Linda proved to be a good sport about embracing the change, and out of the &apos;80s emerged lead roles in two cult classics: the women-in-prison film Chained Heat (1983) and the femme fatale vigilante action film Savage Streets (1984). She continued acting in numerous films throughout the &apos;80s and &apos;90s, including the Exorcist spoof Riposseduta (1990). In 1997, she also took to the Broadway stage and starred as &quot;Rizzo&quot; in the revival of &quot;Grease.&quot; She received widespread mainstream attention again in the 2000&apos;s with the theatrical re-release of the Exorcist, followed by a hosting job on the hit Fox Family TV series Scariest Places on Earth (2000), which ran for six years and followed Linda as she visited notorious &quot;haunted&quot; locations around the world.Linda was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Elinore, a real estate agent, and James, an executive headhunter. She has a brother, Jimmy, and a sister, Debbie. Linda has been a Hollywood icon for over 40 years, but it is her first love of animals that has ultimately taken center stage in her life. She now runs the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation, a non-profit 501C3 tax deductible organization dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating abused, neglected, and abandoned animals from the harsh streets of the Los Angeles area, as well as from the overcrowded and overwhelmed city and county animal shelters. She works and lives on the 2-acre rescue sanctuary full-time in California, which was featured on The Today Show in a segment titled &quot;From Devil to Angel.&quot; Of course, she also makes frequent appearances at horror fan conventions to celebrate the legacy of L&apos;esorcista (1973) .</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Mel Blanc, known as &quot;The Man of Thousand Voices&quot; is regarded as the most prolific actor to ever work in Hollywood with over a thousand screen credits. He developed and performed nearly 400 distinct character voices with precision and a uniquely expressive vocal range. The legendary specialist from radio programs, television series, cartoon shorts and movie was rarely seen by his audience but his voice characterizations were famous around the world.Blanc under exclusive contract until 1960 to Warner Brothers voiced virtually every major character in the Warner Brothers&apos; Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies cartoon pantheon. Characters including Porky Pig, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Wile E. Coyote,The Roadrunner, Yosemite Sam, Sam the Sheepdog, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Speedy Gonzales, Marvin the Martian, Foghorn Leghorn, PepÃ© la Pew, Charlie the Dog, Blacque Jacque Shellacque, Pussyfoot, Private Snafu among others were voiced by Blanc.After 1960, Blanc continued to work for Warner Brothers but began to work for other companies once his exclusive contract ended. He worked for Hanna-Barbera voicing characters including Barney Rubble, Dino the Dinosaur, Cosmo Spacely, Secret Squirrel, Captain Caveman, Speed Buggy, Wally Gator among others. He provided vocal effects for Tom &amp; Jerry in the mid 1960&apos;s working with fellow Warner Bros. alum, Chuck Jones at what would become MGM Animation. In the mid 1960&apos;s, Blanc originated and voiced Toucan Sam for the Kellogg&apos;s Fruit Loops commercials. He would later go to originate and voice Twiki for Buck Rogers and Heathcliff in the late 1970&apos;s and early 1980&apos;s.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Boisterous British actor Brian Blessed is known for his hearty, king-sized portrayals on film and television. A giant of a man accompanied by an eloquent wit and booming, operatic voice, Brian was born in 1936 and grew up in the mining village of Goldthorpe in South Yorkshire. His father was a miner who wanted a better life for his son; Brian lost three uncles in the pit. At a young age, he displayed an acute talent for acting in school productions, but also had a penchant for boxing, a direction that would be short-lived.Working various blue-collar jobs from undertaker&apos;s assistant to plasterer, Brian managed to attend the Bristol Old Vic and was off and running. He has lent his musical talents to several productions - from playing &quot;Old Deuteronomy&quot; in &quot;Cats&quot; to &quot;The Baron&quot; in the more recent &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;. In the 1970s, he began appearing more and more on-camera with both classical and contemporary performances. In costumed television movies, he has played &quot;Porthos&quot; in The Three Musketeers (1966) and The Further Adventures of the Musketeers (1967), &quot;Augustus&quot; in Claudius (1976), and &quot;Long John Silver&quot; in John Silver&apos;s Return to Treasure Island (1986) and has been a part of various reenactments including Caterina di Russia (1995), Lady Chatterley (1993), Il mastino di Baskerville (1983) and Avventure nei mari del nord (1995).On film, he has appeared in robust support in several William Shakespeare adaptations, including Enrico V (1989), Molto rumore per nulla (1993), Hamlet (1996), Macbeth (1997) and the title role in King Lear (1999), which he also directed.More recently, he appeared in Oliver Stone&apos;s epic-scale Alexander (2004) and in Kenneth Branagh&apos;s film version of William Shakespeare&apos;s Come vi piace (2006).In recent years, the octogenarian has been heard more than seen with voice work in video games, documentaries and such animated TV programs as Kika &amp; Bob (2007) (as Bob); Lo straordinario mondo di Gumball (2011) (as Santa Claus); Wizards vs. Aliens (2012) (as the Necross King); Henry Hugglemonster (2013) (as Eduardo Enormomonster); and Peppa Pig (2004) as Grampy Rabbit.He is married to British actress Hildegard Neil, who made an appearance with him in Macbeth (1997).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1966-05-26</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Helena Bonham Carter is an actress of great versatility, one of the UK&apos;s finest and most successful.Bonham Carter was born May 26, 1966 in Golders Green, London, England, the youngest of three children of Elena (nÃ©e Propper de CallejÃ³n), a psychotherapist, and Raymond Bonham Carter, a merchant banker. Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter&apos;s great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Pigmalione (1938) and L&apos;importanza di chiamarsi Ernesto (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de CallejÃ³n, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo&apos;s own father was a Czech Jew). Helena&apos;s maternal grandmother, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband&apos;s Catholic faith.Bonham Carter experienced family dramas during her childhood, including her father&apos;s stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory &quot;Spotlight.&quot; She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie A Pattern of Roses (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films Camera con vista (1985), director James Ivory&apos;s tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster&apos;s novel, and Lady Jane (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Monteriano - Dove gli angeli non osano metter piede (1991) and Casa Howard (1992).Often referred to as the &quot;corset queen&quot; or &quot;English rose&quot; because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in Le ali dell&apos;amore (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Fight Club (1999). Her acclaimed performance in Le ali dell&apos;amore (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association.In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late &apos;90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson&apos;s Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass&apos; La teoria del volo (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn&apos;s La dodicesima notte (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his La dea dell&apos;amore (1995); Mort Ransen&apos;s Il museo di Margaret (1995); Kenneth Branagh&apos;s Frankenstein di Mary Shelley (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli&apos;s Amleto (1990).Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton&apos;s remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish - Le storie di una vita incredibile (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch.In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two-parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann&apos;s Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson&apos;s junkie fiancÃ©e, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall&apos;s heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White.Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton&apos;s film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd - Il diabolico barbiere di Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton&apos;s massive hit La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in Wallace &amp; Gromit - La maledizione del coniglio mannaro (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton&apos;s spooky La sposa cadavere (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart.After their meeting while filming Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton made seven films together. They lived in adjoining residences in London, shared a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, born in 2003, and Nell Burton, who was born in 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ernest Borgnine was born Ermes Effron Borgnino on January 24, 1917 in Hamden, Connecticut. His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield&apos;s famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in &quot;Harvey&quot;.In 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant &quot;Fatso&quot; Judson in Da qui all&apos;eternitÃ  (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as &quot;heavies&quot; in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty - Vita di un timido (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as Pranzo di nozze (1956), Base artica Zebra (1968) and L&apos;imperatore del Nord (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series Un equipaggio tutto matto (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Supercopter (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series The Single Guy (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies.Ernest Borgnine has often stated that acting was his greatest passion. His amazing 61-year career (1951 - 2012) included appearances in well over 100 feature films and as a regular in three television series, as well as voice-overs in animated films such as Le nuove avventure di Charlie (1996), Small Soldiers (1998), and a continued role in the series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999). Between 1973 until his death, Ernest was married to Tova Traesnaes, who heads her own cosmetics company. They lived in Beverly Hills, California, where Ernest assisted his wife between film projects. When not acting, Ernest actively supported numerous charities and spoke tirelessly at benefits throughout the country. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from colleges across the United States as well as numerous Lifetime Achievement Awards. In 1996, Ernest purchased a bus and traveled across the United States to see the country and meet his many fans. On December 17, 1999, he presented the University of North Alabama with a collection of scripts from his film and television career, due to his long friendship with North Alabama alumnus and actor George Lindsey (died May 6, 2012), who was an artist in residence at North Alabama.Ernest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn (1926-2013)</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1947-01-08</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David Bowie was one of the most influential and prolific writers and performers of popular music, but he was much more than that; he was also an accomplished actor, a mime and an intellectual, as well as an art lover whose appreciation and knowledge of it had led to him amassing one of the biggest collections of 20th century art.Born David Jones, he changed his name to Bowie in the 1960s, to avoid confusion with the then well-known Davy Jones (lead singer of The Monkees). The 1960s were not a happy period for Bowie, who remained a struggling artist, awaiting his breakthrough. He dabbled in many different styles of music (without commercial success), and other art forms such as acting, mime, painting, and play-writing. He finally achieved his commercial breakthrough in 1969 with the song &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, which was released at the time of the moon landing. Despite the fact that the literal meaning of the lyrics relates to an astronaut who is lost in space, this song was used by the BBC in their coverage of the moon landing, and this helped it become such a success. The album, which followed &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, and the two, which followed (one of which included the song &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot;, covered by Lulu and Nirvana) failed to produce another hit single, and Bowie&apos;s career appeared to be in decline.However, he made the first of many successful &quot;comebacks&quot; in 1972 with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, a concept album about a space-age rock star. This album was followed by others in a similar vein, rock albums built around a central character and concerned with futuristic themes of Armageddon, gender dysfunction/confusion, as well as more contemporary themes such as the destructiveness of success and fame, and the dangers inherent in star worship. In the mid-1970s, Bowie was a heavy cocaine abuser and sometime heroin user.In 1975, he changed tack. Musically, he released &quot;Young Americans&quot;, a soul (or plastic soul as he later referred to it) album. This produced his first number one hit in the US, &quot;Fame&quot;. He also appeared in his first major film, L&apos;uomo che cadde sulla Terra (1976). With a permanently-dilated pupil and skeletal frame, he certainly looked the part of an alien. The following year, he released &quot;Station to Station,&quot; containing some of the material he had written for the soundtrack to this film (which was not used). As his drug problem heightened, his behavior became more erratic. Reports of his insanity started to appear, and he continued to waste away physically. He fled back to Europe, finally settling in Berlin, where he changed musical direction again and recorded three of the most influential albums of all time, an electronic trilogy with Brian Eno &quot;Low, Heroes and Lodger&quot;. Towards the end of the 1970s, he finally kicked his drug habit, and recorded the album many of his fans consider his best, the Japanese-influenced &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. Around this time, he appeared in the title role of the Broadway drama The Elephant Man, and to considerable acclaim.The next few years saw something of a drop-off in his musical output as his acting career flourished, culminating in his acclaimed performance in Furyo (1983). In 1983, he released &quot;Let&apos;s Dance,&quot; an album which proved an unexpected massive commercial success, and produced his second #1 hit single in the United States. According to producer Nile Rodgers, the album was made in just 17 days and was &quot;the easiest album&quot; he&apos;d ever made in his life. The tour which followed, &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot;, was his most successful ever. Faced with this success on a massive scale, Bowie apparently attempted to &quot;repeat the formula&quot; in the next two albums, with less success (and to critical scorn). Finally, in the late 1980s, he turned his back on commercial success and his solo career, forming the hard rock band, Tin Machine, who had a deliberate limited appeal. By now, his acting career was in decline. After the comparative failure of Labyrinth - Dove tutto Ã¨ possibile (1986), the movie industry appears to have decided that Bowie was not a sufficient name to be a lead actor in a major movie, and since that date, most of his roles have been cameos or glorified cameos. Tin Machine toured extensively and released two albums, with little critical or commercial success.In 1992, Bowie again changed direction and re-launched his solo career with &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, a wedding album inspired by his recent marriage to Iman. He released three albums to considerable critical acclaim and reasonable commercial success. In 1995, he renewed his working relationship with Brian Eno to record &quot;Outside.&quot; After an initial hostile reaction from the critics, this album has now taken its place with his classic albums. In 2003, Bowie released an album entitled &apos;Reality.&apos; The Reality Tour began in November 2003 and, after great commercial success, was extended into July 2004. In June 2004, Bowie suffered a heart attack and the tour did not finish its scheduled run.After recovering, Bowie gave what turned out to be his final live performance in a three-song set with Alicia Keys at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York in November 2006. He also returned to acting. He played Tesla in The Prestige (2006) and had a small cameo in the comedy Extras: David Bowie (2006) for fan Ricky Gervais. In 2007, he did a cartoon voice in SpongeBob SquarePants (1999) playing Lord Royal Highness. He had a brief cameo in the movie &apos;&apos;Bandslam&apos;&apos; released in 2009; after a ten year hiatus from recording, he released a new album called &apos;The Next Day.&apos;,featuring a homage cover to his earlier work &apos;&apos;Heroes&apos;&apos;. The music video of &apos;&apos;Stars are Out Tonight&apos;&apos; premiered on 25 February 2013. It consists of other songs like &apos;&apos;Where Are We Now?&quot;, &quot;Valentine&apos;s Day&quot;, &quot;Love is Lost&quot;, &quot;The Next Day&quot;, etc.In 2014, Bowie won British Male Solo Artist at the 2014 Brit Awards, 30 years since last winning it, and became the oldest ever Brit winner. Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television miniseries The Last Panthers (2015), which aired in November 2015. The theme used for The Last Panthers (2015) was also the title track for his January 2016 release, &apos;&apos;Blackstar&quot; (released on 8 January 2016, Bowie&apos;s 69th birthday) was met with critical acclaim. Following Bowie&apos;s death two days later, on 10 January 2016, producer Tony Visconti revealed Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a &quot;parting gift&quot; for his fans before his death. An EP, No Plan, was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie&apos;s 70th birthday. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie&apos;s music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo&apos;s most viewed artist in a single day.On 15 January, &quot;Blackstar&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. The song also debuted at #1 on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the US Billboard 200. At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, Bowie won all five nominated awards: Best Rock Performance; Best Alternative Music Album; Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Recording Package; and Best Rock Song. The wins marked Bowie&apos;s first ever in musical categories. David Bowie influenced the course of popular music several times and had an effect on several generations of musicians.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As one of Hollywood&apos;s leading men, Bruce Boxleitner has starred in a major motion picture franchise, numerous feature films, and several popular television series, produced a major network film and TV series, performed on Broadway, and authored two science fiction novels.Boxleitner received his formal acting training on stage. A native mid-westerner, he is an alumnus of Chicago&apos;s prestigious Goodman Theatre. In 1972, he starred in the Broadway production of Status Quo Vadis with Ted Danson. He then relocated to Los Angeles and quickly landed a guest spot on the legendary TV series Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970) as well as numerous guest roles on series, including Hawaii Five-O (1968), Baretta (1975), Pepper Anderson agente speciale (1974), and Gunsmoke (1955).Boxleitner&apos;s big break occurred when he was cast opposite James Arness in the pilot for the epic TV series Alla conquista del West (1976).

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1949-12-04</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jeffrey Leon Bridges was born on December 4, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, the son of well-known film and TV star Lloyd Bridges and his long-time wife Dorothy Dean Bridges (nÃ©e Simpson). He grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother Beau Bridges. Both boys popped up, without billing, alongside their mother in the film N.N. vigilata speciale (1951), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series L&apos;uomo del mare (1958) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot;. The &quot;troublesome teen&quot; years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand.He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1978). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Halls of Anger (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film L&apos;ultimo spettacolo (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for &quot;best supporting actor&quot;), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable).Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in CittÃ  amara (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western Cattive compagnie (1972); his redneck stock car racer in Il diavolo del volante (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in Una calibro 20 per lo specialista (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Scandalo al ranch (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Pazzo pazzo West! (1975); and the brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Rebus per un assassinio (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn&apos;t.Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic Tron (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in I favolosi Baker (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in Starman (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker - Un uomo e il suo sogno (1988).Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. La leggenda del re pescatore (1991), American Heart (1992), Fearless - Senza paura (1993), Il grande Lebowski (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and The Contender (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.&apos;s nemesis in Iron Man (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart (2009). Bridges next starred in Tron: Legacy (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake Il Grinta (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama The Giver - Il mondo di Jonas (2014).Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Scandalo al ranch (1975)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician. His ancestry is English, and smaller amounts of Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), Irish, Swiss-German, and German.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1921-11-03</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The archetypal screen tough guy with weatherbeaten features--one film critic described his rugged looks as &quot;a Clark Gable who had been left out in the sun too long&quot;--Charles Bronson was born Charles Buchinsky, one of 15 children of struggling parents in Pennsylvania. His mother, Mary (Valinsky), was born in Pennsylvania, to Lithuanian parents, and his father, Walter Buchinsky, was a Lithuanian immigrant coal miner.He completed high school and joined his father in the mines (an experience that resulted in a lifetime fear of being in enclosed spaces) and then served in WW II. After his return from the war, Bronson used the GI Bill to study art (a passion he had for the rest of his life), then enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. One of his teachers was impressed with the young man and recommended him to director Henry Hathaway, resulting in Bronson making his film debut in Il comandante Johnny (1951).He appeared on screen often early in his career, though usually uncredited. However, he made an impact on audiences as the evil assistant to Vincent Price in the 3-D thriller La maschera di cera (1953). His sinewy yet muscular physique got him cast in action-type roles, often without a shirt to highlight his manly frame. He received positive notices from critics for his performances in Vera Cruz (1954), Ombre gialle (1955) and La tortura della freccia (1957). Indie director Roger Corman cast him as the lead in his well-received low-budget gangster flick La legge del mitra (1958), then Bronson scored the lead in his own TV series, Man with a Camera (1958). The 1960s proved to be the era in which Bronson made his reputation as a man of few words but much action.Director John Sturges cast him as half Irish/half Mexican gunslinger Bernardo O&apos;Reilly in the smash hit western I magnifici sette (1960), and hired him again as tunnel rat Danny Velinski for the WWII POW big-budget epic La grande fuga (1963). Several more strong roles followed, then once again he was back in military uniform, alongside Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine in the testosterone-filled Quella sporca dozzina (1967).European audiences had taken a shine to his minimalist acting style, and he headed to the Continent to star in several action-oriented films, including I cannoni di San Sebastian (1968) (aka &quot;Guns for San Sebastian&quot;), the cult western C&apos;era una volta il West (1968) (aka &quot;Once Upon a Time in The West&quot;), L&apos;uomo venuto dalla pioggia (1970) (aka &quot;Rider On The Rain&quot;) and, in one of the quirkier examples of international casting, alongside Japansese screen legend ToshirÃ´ Mifune in the western Sole rosso (1971) (aka &quot;Red Sun&quot;).American audiences were by now keen to see Bronson back on US soil, and he returned triumphantly in the early 1970s to take the lead in more hard-edged crime and western dramas, including Joe Valachi - I segreti di Cosa Nostra (1972) and the revenge western Chato (1972). After nearly 25 years as a working actor, he became an &apos;overnight&quot; sensation. Bronson then hooked up with British director Michael Winner to star in several highly successful urban crime thrillers, including Professione: assassino (1972) and L&apos;assassino di pietra (1973). He then scored a solid hit as a Colorado melon farmer-done-wrong in Richard Fleischer&apos;s A muso duro (1974). However, the film that proved to be a breakthrough for both Bronson and Winner came in 1974 with the release of the controversial Il giustiziere della notte (1974) (written with Henry Fonda in mind, who turned it down because he was disgusted by the script).The US was at the time in the midst of rising street crime, and audiences flocked to see a story about a mild-mannered architect who seeks revenge for the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter by gunning down hoods, rapists and killers on the streets of New York City. So popular was the film that it spawned four sequels over the next 20 years.Action fans could not get enough of tough guy Bronson, and he appeared in what many fans--and critics--consider his best role: Depression-era street fighter Chaney alongside James Coburn in L&apos;eroe della strada (1975). That was followed by the somewhat slow-paced western Io non credo a nessuno (1975) (with wife Jill Ireland), the light-hearted romp (a flop) Da mezzogiorno alle tre (1976) and as Soviet agent Grigori Borsov in director Don Siegel&apos;s Cold War thriller Telefon (1977).Bronson remained busy throughout the 1980s, with most of his films taking a more violent tone, and he was pitched as an avenging angel eradicating evildoers in films like the 10 minuti a mezzanotte (1983), Professione giustiziere (1984), Assassination (1987) and Soggetti proibiti (1989). Bronson jolted many critics with his forceful work as murdered United Mine Workers leader Jock Yablonski in the TV movie L&apos;esecuzione... una storia vera (1986), gave a very interesting performance in the Sean Penn-directed Lupo solitario (1991) and surprised everyone with his appearance as compassionate newspaper editor Francis Church in the family film Yes Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus (1991).Bronson&apos;s final film roles were as police commissioner Paul Fein in a well-received trio of crime/drama TV movies Sospetti in famiglia (1995), Sospetti in famiglia 2 (1997) and Sospetti in famiglia 3 (1999). Unfortunately, ill health began to take its toll; he suffered from Alzheimer&apos;s disease for the last few years of his life, and finally passed away from pneumonia at Los Angeles&apos; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in August 2003.Bronson was a true icon of international cinema; critics had few good things to say about his films, but he remained a fan favorite in both the US and abroad for 50 years, a claim few other film legends can make.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Mary Louise Brooks, also known by her childhood name of Brooksie, was born in the midwestern town of Cherryvale, Kansas, on November 14, 1906. She began dancing at an early age with the Denishawn Dancers (which was how she left Kansas and went to New York) and then with George White&apos;s Scandals before joining the Ziegfeld Follies, but became one of the most fascinating and alluring personalities ever to grace the silver screen. She was always compared to her Lulu role in Il vaso di Pandora (1929), which was filmed in 1928. Her performances in Capitan BarbablÃ¹ (1928) and I mendicanti della vita (1928), both filmed in 1928, proved to all concerned that Louise had real talent. She became known, mostly, for her bobbed hair style. Thousands of women were attracted to that style and adopted it as their own. As you will note by her photographs, she was no doubt the trend setter of the 1920s with her Buster Brown-Page Boy type hair cut, much like today&apos;s women imitate stars. Because of her dark haired look and being the beautiful woman that she was, plus being a modern female, she was not especially popular among Hollywood&apos;s clientle. She just did not go along with the norms of the film society. Louise really came into her own when she left Hollywood for Europe. There she appeared in a few German productions which were very well made and continued to prove she was an actress with an enduring talent. Until she ended her career in film in 1938, she had made only 25 movies. After that, she spent most of her time reading and painting. She also became an accomplished writer, authoring a number of books, including her autobiography. On August 8, 1985, Louise died of a heart attack in Rochester, New York. She was 78 years old.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A tall, wavy-haired US actor with a deep, resonant voice, Clancy Brown has proved himself a versatile performer with first-class contributions to theater, feature films, television series and even animation.Clarence J. Brown III was born in 1959 in Urbana, Ohio, to Joyce Helen (Eldridge), a concert pianist, conductor, and composer, and Republican congressman Clarence J. &quot;Bud&quot; Brown, Jr., who helped manage the Brown Publishing Company, the family-owned newspaper started by Clancy&apos;s grandfather, Congressman Clarence J. Brown. Clancy spent much of his youth in close proximity to Washington, D.C. He plied his dramatic talents in the Chicago theater scene before moving onto feature film with a sinister debut performance bullying Sean Penn inside a youth reformatory in Bad Boys (1983). He portrayed Viktor the Monster in the unusual spin on the classic Frankenstein story in La sposa promessa (1985), before scoring one of his best roles to date as the evil Kurgan hunting fellow immortals Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery across four centuries of time in Highlander - L&apos;ultimo immortale (1986).Brown played a corrupt American soldier in the Walter Hill-directed hyper-violent action film Ricercati: ufficialmente morti (1987), another deranged killer in Sulle tracce dell&apos;assassino (1988) and a brutal prison guard, who eventually somewhat &quot;befriends&quot; wrongfully convicted banker Tim Robbins, in the moving Le ali della libertÃ  (1994). His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks: Quattro pinne all&apos;orizzonte (1994), Gargoyles (1994) and Le avventure di Superman (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a &quot;tough-as-nails&quot; drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers - Fanteria dello spazio (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber - Un professore tra le nuvole (1997).The video gaming industry took notice of Clancy&apos;s vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003). His voice is also the character of cranky crustacean Mr. Eugene H. Krabs in the highly successful SpongeBob SquarePants (1999) animated series and films, and he contributed voices to The Batman (2004), Le avventure di Jackie Chan (2000) and Justice League (2001) animated series. A popular and friendly personality, Clancy Brown continues to remain busy both through his vocal and acting talents in Hollywood.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Timothy Walter Burton was born in Burbank, California, to Jean Rae (Erickson), who owned a cat-themed gift shop, and William Reed Burton, who worked for the Burbank Park and Recreation Department. He spent most of his childhood as a recluse, drawing cartoons, and watching old movies (he was especially fond of films with Vincent Price). When he was in the ninth grade, his artistic talent was recognized by a local garbage company, when he won a prize for an anti-litter poster he designed. The company placed this poster on all of their garbage trucks for a year. After graduating from high school, he attended California Institute of the Arts. Like so many others who graduated from that school, Burton&apos;s first job was as an animator for Disney.His early film career was fueled by almost unbelievable good luck, but it&apos;s his talent and originality that have kept him at the top of the Hollywood tree. He worked on such films as Red e Toby nemiciamici (1981) and Taron e la pentola magica (1985), but had some creative differences with his colleagues. Nevertheless, Disney recognized his talent, and gave him the green light to make Vincent (1982), an animated short about a boy who wanted to be just like Vincent Price. Narrated by Price himself, the short was a critical success and won several awards. Burton made a few other short films, including his first live-action film, Frankenweenie (1984). A half-hour long twist on the tale of Frankenstein, it was deemed inappropriate for children and wasn&apos;t released. But actor Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) saw Frankenweenie (1984), and believed that Burton would be the right man to direct him in his first full-length feature film, Pee-wee&apos;s Big Adventure (1985). The film was a surprise success, and Burton instantly became popular. However, many of the scripts that were offered to him after this were essentially just spin-offs of the film, and Burton wanted to do something new.For three years, he made no more films, until he was presented with the script for Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988). The script was wild and wasn&apos;t really about anything, but was filled with such artistic and quirky opportunities, Burton couldn&apos;t say no. Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988) was another big hit, and Burton&apos;s name in Hollywood was solidified. It was also his first film with actor Michael Keaton. Warner Bros. then entrusted him with Batman (1989), a film based on the immensely popular comic book series of the same name. Starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, the film was the most financially successful film of the year and Burton&apos;s biggest box-office hit to date. Due to the fantastic success of his first three films, he was given the green light to make his next film, any kind of film he wanted. That film was Edward mani di forbice (1990), one of his most emotional, esteemed and artistic films to date. Edward mani di forbice (1990) was also Burton&apos;s first film with actor Johnny Depp. Burton&apos;s next film was Batman - Il ritorno (1992), and was darker and quirkier than the first one, and, while by no means a financial flop, many people felt somewhat disappointed by it. While working on Batman - Il ritorno (1992), he also produced the popular Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), directed by former fellow Disney Animator Henry Selick. Burton reunited with Johnny Depp on the film Ed Wood (1994), a film showered with critical acclaim, Martin Landau won an academy award for his performance in it, and it is very popular now, but flopped during its initial release. Burton&apos;s subsequent film, Mars Attacks! (1996), had much more vibrant colors than his other films. Despite being directed by Burton and featuring all-star actors including Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Pierce Brosnan and Michael J. Fox, it received mediocre reviews and wasn&apos;t immensely popular at the box office, either.Burton returned to his darker and more artistic form with the film Il mistero di Sleepy Hollow (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Casper Van Dien. The film was praised for its art direction and was financially successful, redeeming Burton of the disappointment many had felt by Mars Attacks! (1996). His next film was Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001), a remake of the classic of the same name. The film was panned by many critics but was still financially successful. While on the set of Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001), Burton met Helena Bonham Carter, with whom he has two children. Burton directed the film Big Fish - Le storie di una vita incredibile (2003) - a much more conventional film than most of his others, it received a good deal of critical praise, although it disappointed some of his long-time fans who preferred the quirkiness of his other, earlier films. Despite the fluctuations in his career, Burton proved himself to be one of the most popular directors of the late 20th century. He directed Johnny Depp once again in La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005), a film as quirky anything he&apos;s ever done.</rdfs:comment>

Her father is Joe Butler, the lead singer and drummer for the reunited Lovin&apos; Spoonful; her mother, Leslie , was a company manager for Broadway shows, and her grandparents were also involved in various aspects of the theater. At the age of 13, Butler began studying at the prestigious HB Studios in New York, and continued to do so until entering Sarah Lawrence College. Ms Butler made her motion picture starring debut in John Woo&apos;s &quot;Hard Target&quot; with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Yancy&apos;s television debut in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; landed her the series lead in &quot;Mann and Machine&quot;, which led to the starring role in &quot;South Beach.&quot;</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The father of cinematic Surrealism and one of the most original directors in the history of the film medium, Luis BuÃ±uel was given a strict Jesuit education (which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both religion and subversive behavior), and subsequently moved to Madrid to study at the university there, where his close friends included Salvador DalÃ­ and Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca.After moving to Paris, BuÃ±uel did a variety of film-related odd jobs in Paris, including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein. With financial assistance from his mother and creative assistance from DalÃ­, he made his first film, the 17-minute Un chien andalou (1929), in 1929, and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its shocking imagery (much of which - like the sliced eyeball at the beginning - still packs a punch even today). It made a deep impression on the Surrealist Group, who welcomed BuÃ±uel into their ranks.The following year, sponsored by wealthy art patrons, he made his first feature, the scabrous witty and violent L&apos;Ã¢ge d&apos;or (1930), which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes, themes that would preoccupy BuÃ±uel for the rest of his career. That career, though, seemed almost over by the mid-1930s, as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War he emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros.Moving to Mexico in the late 1940s, he teamed up with producer Ã“scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in I figli della violenza (1950), winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival.But despite this new-found acclaim, BuÃ±uel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultra-low-budget films, few of which made much impact outside Spanish-speaking countries (though many of them are well worth seeking out). But in 1961, General Franco, anxious to be seen to be supporting Spanish culture invited BuÃ±uel back to his native country - and Bunuel promptly bit the hand that fed him by making Viridiana (1961), which was banned in Spain on the grounds of blasphemy, though it won the Palme d&apos;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.This inaugurated BuÃ±uel&apos;s last great period when, in collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer Jean-Claude CarriÃ¨re he made seven extraordinary late masterpieces, starting with Il diario di una cameriera (1964). Although far glossier and more expensive, and often featuring major stars such as Jeanne Moreau and Catherine Deneuve, the films showed that even in old age BuÃ±uel had lost none of his youthful vigour.After saying that every one of his films from Bella di giorno (1967) onwards would be his last, he finally kept his promise with Quell&apos;oscuro oggetto del desiderio (1977), after which he wrote a memorable (if factually dubious) autobiography, in which he said he&apos;d be happy to burn all the prints of all his films</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emmanuelle BÃ©art was born August 14, 1963, in Gassin, France. She lived with her mother, brothers, and sister on a farm not far from Saint-Tropez in Provence (southern France), because her father, singer and poet Guy BÃ©art, did not want his children to be affected by the glamour world of Paris. When Emmanuelle was thirteen, she saw Romy Schneider in the movie Mado (1976). From that time on, she wanted to be an actress. In Emmanuelle&apos;s teens, her parents sent her to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for four years, so she could learn English. There, she was engaged for a Robert Altman movie that was never made. After returning to France, she took drama classes and got her first TV role, in Raison perdue (1984). David Hamilton, the photographer/director, was impressed by her beauty and gave her a role in Premiers dÃ©sirs (1983). She met her spouse-to-be, Daniel Auteuil, while making L&apos;amour en douce (1985). The film that made her famous in France was Manon delle sorgenti (1986), in which she played the role of a blonde shepherd dancing nude in the fields. Director Tom McLoughlin chose her out of 5,000 candidates for her first Hollywood picture, Appuntamento con un angelo (1987). Emmanuelle is a very sensitive and a perfectionist. For the part of Camille in the film Un cuore in inverno (1992), she took violin lessons for a whole year. Her biggest success was as a nude model in the art film La bella scontrosa (1991), which starred Michel Piccoli and was directed by Jacques Rivette.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen Frances Marie (Burchell), a charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish-market porter. He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised L&apos;ammutinamento del Caine (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot;.Zulu (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although &quot;Zulu&quot; was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in Ipcress (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit - Grande furto al Semiramis (1966), Funerale a Berlino (1966), I 7 senza gloria (1969), I lunghi giorni delle aquile (1969), Non Ã¨ piÃ¹ tempo d&apos;eroi (1970), L&apos;ultima valle (1971) and especially Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.However, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in L&apos;uomo che volle farsi re (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in La notte dell&apos;aquila (1976). Rita Rita (1983) and Hannah e le sue sorelle (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice - Ãˆ nata una stella (1998), Le regole della casa del sidro (1999) (his second Oscar) and L&apos;ultimo bicchiere (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan&apos;s Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan&apos;s films including The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso CuarÃ³n&apos;s I figli degli uomini (2006) and Pixar&apos;s sequel Cars 2 (2011).As of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.</rdfs:comment>

This stunning former model became best known for her screen performances playing a sinister femme fatale. In doing so, she has achieved minor cult status and has quite a loyal fanbase. The tall and tanned Carrera first cropped up in minor roles taking advantage of her exotic features in Il giorno del grande massacro (1975), Embryo (1976) and L&apos;isola del dottor Moreau (1977). She broke through with mainstream North American audiences playing Clay Basket in the miniseries Colorado (1978), and Lucia Flavius Silva&apos;s mistress in the miniseries Masada (1981).She sizzled on screen with Armand Assante as the sexy yet evil doctor in Io, la giuria (1982), was the love interest of Texas Ranger Chuck Norris in Una magnum per McQuade (1983), and gave her best role to date as assassin Fatima Blush opposite Sean Connery in Mai dire mai (1983), and then as Emma Forsayth in the miniseries Emma: la regina dei Mari del Sud (1988). In 1985-86, she played the role of business executive Angelica Nero on the primetime soap opera Dallas (1978).

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1956-01-07</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">His low-keyed intensity, deep-voiced somberness, pale skin, puffy-eyed baby face and crop of carrot-red hair are all obvious and intriguing trademarks of TV star David Caruso. A hugely popular item in the 1990s as a result of a smash crime series, he got way too caught up in all the hoopla surrounding him. Those working with him on the innovative cop series were not exactly unhappy when he decided to abandon ship after only one season in order to pursue movie star fame. Despite his own predictions, the show prospered quite well after the loss of his focal character...but it would be a major understatement to state that Caruso did not fare as well.TV to film crossover fame is tricky and David did not have the right formula to pull it off. Bad judgment calls, bad publicity after his departure from his TV series, a couple of poor film vehicles, and virtual unemployment in its wake eventually led him back to the small screen again a somewhat humbler person. Not many are given a second chance but Caruso, the enigmatic talent that he is, found gold a second time as (again) a wan, brooding lead in a hip, unconventional cop series.David Stephen Caruso was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, the son of Charles Caruso, a magazine and newspaper editor, and Joan, a librarian. The Irish Catholic youngster attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs and then Archbishop Molloy High School, both in Queens.Following high school graduation in 1974, he toyed with some commercial work. A few years later he began to make a slight dent in films. He first appeared in I ragazzi dell&apos;accademia militare (1980) and Horror - Caccia ai terrestri (1980), which led to a succession of secondary roles in such 80s movies as Ufficiale e gentiluomo (1982), Rambo (1982) (as a sheriff&apos;s deputy), Ladro di donne (1984), Blue City (1986), China Girl (1987) and I gemelli (1988). But the break into full-fledged TV stardom proved elusive. It was argued that the thin and lanky actor was not handsome enough to become a leading man in film and didn&apos;t have the charisma credentials to carry a big movie.Making his unbilled debut in a daytime episode of &quot;Ryan&apos;s Hope&quot;, TV proved to be a more inviting medium and police stories seemed to be the name of the game for him. He had a strong recurring role as a gang leader on Hill Street giorno e notte (1981) and showed to good advantage in the series Crime Story (1986). This sudden notoriety on police TV gave way to some even stronger stuff in streetwise film crimers such as King of New York (1990) as a cop gone bad, and Lo sbirro, il boss e la bionda (1993), in which he earned excellent marks as a cynical urban cop. But his star-making role came via TV and his portrayal of Detective John Kelly the critically-acclaimed series New York Police Department (1993). Audience adoration was immediate.His volatile but principled character on the gritty, boldly-written, unconventional show earned him impressive and sexy notices with a Golden Globe Award and Emmy nomination placed in his hands. Confident now that he could be a magnetic force in front of a movie camera, stories began to circulate that the instant fame had gone to his head, that he was moody, demanding and difficult on the set, and that he was quickly alienating not only his co-stars but the show&apos;s directors and writers.Ready to prove all those naysayers wrong about his chances in film, Caruso made tabloid headlines when he announced his decision to leave the highly-rated show after only one season (and only four episodes into the second season) to pursue film stardom. Rumors also bounced around that he left following unresolved salary negotiations. For whatever reason, he wasted no time in scouting out movie vehicles for himself. Again, he focused on his specialty -- crime thrillers. The first, Il bacio della morte (1995), in which he played a petty thief trying to go straight, did not go over well box-office-wise despite its good reviews, and the second, Jade (1995), in which he portrayed a homicide detective, was a grisly, unappetizing thriller that was given the thumbs down almost immediately. As a comeuppance for coming up short, he was nominated for the dubious &quot;Razzie&quot; award as the &quot;Worst New Star&quot; of those two films. With no movie releases at all in 1996, by the time Cold Around the Heart (1997) was released, in which he played a jewel thief who is betrayed by his sexy partner-in-crime (Kelly Lynch), the TV star had lost all of his movie star momentum.In 1997, Caruso made an inauspicious return to the small screen as the placid title prosecutor Michael Hayes indaga (1997), a law series, but it was a very short-lived experience. Audiences had become fickle and indifferent to his &quot;heralded comeback&quot;. Finding a serious lack of offers, he returned to supporting others in films such as Russell Crowe in Rapimento e riscatto (2000), and copped a couple of leads for himself in such low-budgeted films as Session 9 (2001) and the Canadian film Black Point (2002).But in 2002, he found TV magic once again behind a badge as Lt. Horatio Caine in the popular CSI spin-off series CSI: Miami (2002). Strongly anchoring the show, which focuses more on crime methodology and whodunnit twists than character development, Caruso has nevertheless earned cult fame for his slick demeanor and deliberately slow speech patterns, reminding one of William Shatner&apos;s heady, methodical approach to Captain Kirk. Known for his deep, dry tones and parade of droll one-liners, many of which include him slipping on his dark shades during mid-sentence, he has been the subject of many a late-nite parody and satire.A difficult interviewee who has admitted to keeping his monumental ego in check since his return to TV, he has been little seen since the &quot;Miami&quot; series ended in 2012 after ten season. David has been married and divorced three times, which includes a brief 1980s union to actress Rachel Ticotin. He has a daughter, Greta, from that union. On the sly, Caruso was a co-owner of now long-defunct Steam, a clothing and furniture store in Miami, Florida. He and his current girlfriend (since 2005), Liza Marquez, have two children -- son Marquez Anthony and and daughter, Paloma Raquel.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Richard Chamberlain became THE leading heartthrob of early 1960s TV. As the impeccably handsome Dr. Kildare, the slim, butter-haired hunk with the near-perfect Ivy-League charm and smooth, intelligent demeanor, had the distaff fans fawning unwavering over him throughout the series&apos; run. While this would appear to be a dream situation for any new star, to Chamberlain it brought about a major, unsettling identity crisis.Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, he was the second son of Elsa Winnifred (von Benzon) (1902-1993) and Charles Axiom Chamberlain (1902-1984), a salesman. He has English and German ancestry. Richard experienced a profoundly unhappy childhood and did not enjoy school at all, making up for it somewhat by excelling in track and becoming a four-year letterman in high school and college. He also developed a strong interest and enjoyment in acting while attending Pomona College. Losing an initial chance to sign up with Paramount Pictures, the studio later renewed interest. Complications arose when he was drafted into the Army on December 7, 1956 for 16 months, serving in Korea.Chamberlain headed for Hollywood soon after his discharge and, in just a couple of years, worked up a decent resumÃ© with a number of visible guest spots on such popular series as Gunsmoke (1955) and Mr. Lucky (1959). But it was the stardom of the medical series Dottor Kildare (1961) that garnered overnight female worship and he became a huge sweater-vested pin-up favorite. It also sparked a brief, modest singing career for the actor.The attention Richard received was phenomenal. True to his &quot;Prince Charming&quot; type, he advanced into typically bland, soap-styled leads on film befitting said image, but crossover stardom proved to be elusive. The vehicles he appeared in, La notte del delitto (1963) with Joey Heatherton and Joy in the Morning (1965) opposite Yvette Mimieux, did not bring him the screen fame foreseen. The public obviously saw the actor as nothing more than a TV commodity.More interested in a reputation as a serious actor, Chamberlain took a huge risk and turned his back on Hollywood, devoting himself to the stage. In 1966 alone he appeared in such legit productions as &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; and &quot;Private Lives,&quot; and also showed off his vocal talents playing Tony in &quot;West Side Story&quot;. In December of that year a musical version of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s&quot; starring Richard and Mary Tyler Moore in the sparkling George Peppard/Audrey Hepburn roles was headed for Broadway. It flopped badly in previews, however, and closed after only four performances. Even today it is still deemed one of Broadway&apos;s biggest musical disasters.An important dramatic role in director Richard Lester&apos;s Petulia (1968) led Richard to England, where he stayed and dared to test his acting prowess on the classical stage. With it, his personal satisfaction over image and career improved. Bravura performances as &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1969) and &quot;Richard II&quot; (1971), as well as his triumph in &quot;The Lady&apos;s Not for Burning&quot; (1972), won over the not-so-easy-to-impress British audiences. And on the classier film front, he ably portrayed Octavius Caesar opposite Charlton Heston&apos;s Mark Antony and Jason Robards&apos; Brutus in 23 pugnali per Cesare (1970), composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell&apos;s grandiose L&apos;altra faccia dell&apos;amore (1971) opposite Glenda Jackson, and Lord Byron alongside Sarah Miles_ in Peccato d&apos;amore (1972). While none of these three films were critical favorites, they were instrumental in helping to reshape Chamberlain&apos;s career as a serious, sturdy and reliable actor.With his new image in place, Richard felt ready to face American audiences again. While he made a triumphant Broadway debut as Reverend Shannon in &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1975), he also enjoyed modest box-office popularity with the action-driven adventure movies I tre moschettieri (1973) as Aramis and a villainous role in L&apos;inferno di cristallo (1974), and earned cult status for the Aussie film L&apos;ultima onda (1977). On the television front, he became a TV idol all over again (on his own terms this time) as the &quot;King of 80s Mini-Movies&quot;. The epic storytelling of Il conte di Montecristo (1975), Uccelli di rovo (1983) and Shogun (1980), all of which earned him Emmy nominations, placed Richard solidly on the quality star list. He won Golden Globe awards for his starring roles in the last two miniseries mentioned.In later years the actor devoted a great deal of his time to musical stage tours as Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Captain Von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;Scrooge: The Musical&quot;. Enormously private and having moved to Hawaii to avoid the Hollywood glare, at age 69 finally &quot;came out&quot; with a tell-all biography entitled &quot;Shattered Love,&quot; in which he quite candidly discussed the anguish of hiding his homosexuality to protect his enduring matinÃ©e idol image.Since then, he has accepted himself and shown to be quite a good sport in the process, appearing as gay characters in the film Io vi dichiaro marito e... marito (2007), and in TV episodes of Will &amp; Grace (1998), Desperate Housewives - I segreti di Wisteria Lane (2004) and Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Hong Kong&apos;s cheeky, lovable and best known film star, Jackie Chan endured many years of long, hard work and multiple injuries to establish international success after his start in Hong Kong&apos;s manic martial arts cinema industry.Jackie was born Kong-sang Chan on April 7, 1954, on Hong Kong&apos;s famous Victoria Peak, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, and the family immigrated to Canberra, Australia, in early 1960. The young Jackie was less than successful scholastically, so his father sent him back to Hong Kong to attend the rigorous China Drama Academy, one of the Peking Opera schools. Chan excelled at acrobatics, singing and martial arts and eventually became a member of the &quot;Seven Little Fortunes&quot; performing troupe and began lifelong friendships with fellow martial artists / actors Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and Biao Yuen. Chan journeyed back and forth to visit his parents and work in Canberra, but eventually he made his way back to Hong Kong as his permanent home. In the early 1970s Chan commenced his movie career and interestingly appeared in very minor roles in two films starring then rising martial arts superstar Bruce Lee: Dalla Cina con furore (1972), aka &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; aka &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;, and the Warner Bros. production I 3 dell&apos;Operazione Drago (1973). Not long after Lee&apos;s untimely death Chan was often cast in films cashing in on the success of Bruce Lee by utilizing words like &quot;fist&quot;, &quot;fury&quot; or &quot;dragon&quot; in their US release titles.Chan&apos;s own film career was off and running and he swiftly appeared in many low-budget martial arts films that were churned out at a rapid fire pace by Hong Kong studios eager to satisfy the early 1970s boom in martial-arts cinema. He starred in Shao Lin mu ren xiang (1976) (aka &quot;Shaolin Wooden Men&quot;), Jian hua yan yu jiang nan (1977) (aka &quot;To Kill With Intrigue&quot;), Yi zhao ban shi chuang jiang hu (1978) (aka &quot;Half A Loaf of Kung Fu&quot;) and Fei du juan yun shan (1978) (aka &quot;Magnificent Bodyguards&quot;), which all fared reasonably well at the cinemas. However, he scored a major breakthrough with the hit Drunken Master (1978) (aka &quot;Drunken Master&quot;), which has become a cult favorite among martial arts film fans. Not too long after this, Chan made his directorial debut with Il ventaglio bianco (1980) (aka &quot;The Young Master&quot;) and then &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; producer Robert Clouse lured Jackie to the US for a film planned to break Jackie into the lucrative US market. Chi tocca il giallo muore (1980) (aka &quot;Battle Creek Brawl&quot;) featured Jackie competing in a &quot;toughest Street fighter&quot; contest set in 1940s Texas; however, Jackie was unhappy with the end result, and it failed to fire with US audiences. In a further attempt to get his name known in the US, Jackie was cast alongside Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore and Dean Martin in the Hal Needham-directed car chase flick La corsa piÃ¹ pazza d&apos;America (1981). Regrettably, Jackie was cast as a Japanese race driver and his martial arts skills are only shown in one small sequence near the film&apos;s conclusion. Stateside success was still a few years away for Jackie Chan!Undeterred, he returned to the Orient to do what he did best--make jaw-dropping action films loaded with amazing stunt work. Chan and his legendary stunt team were unparalleled in their ability to execute the most incredible fight scenes and action sequences, and the next decade would see some of their best work. Chan paired with the dynamic Sammo Hung Kam-Bo to star in Winners and sinners (1983) (aka &quot;Winners &amp; Sinners&quot;), Project A - Operazione pirati (1983) (aka &quot;Project &quot;A&quot;), Il mistero del conte Lobos (1984) (aka &quot;Wheels On Meals&quot;), La gang degli svitati (1985) (aka &quot;Winners &amp; Sinners 2&quot;), Bambole e botte (1985) (aka &quot;My Lucky Stars 2&quot;, aka &quot;Winners &amp; Sinners 3&quot;(. Chan then journeyed back to the US for another shot at that market, starring alongside Danny Aiello in Protector (1985),) filmed in Hong Kong and New York. However, as with previous attempts, Jackie felt the US director--in this case, James Glickenhaus--failed to understand his audience appeal and the film played to lukewarm reviews and box-office receipts. Jackie did, however, decide to &quot;harden&quot; up his on-screen image somewhat and his next film, Police Story (1985) (aka &quot;Police Story&quot;) was a definite departure from previously light-hearted martial arts fare, and his fans loved the final product!This was quickly followed up with the I predatori dell&apos;arca perduta (1981)-influenced Lung hing foo dai (1986) (aka &quot;The Armour of God&quot;), during filming of which Jackie mistimed a leap from a wall to a tree on location in Yugoslavia and fell many quite a few feet onto his head, causing a skull fracture. It was another in a long line of injuries that Chan has suffered as a result of doing his own stunt work, and he was soon back in front of the cameras. Project A II - Operazione pirati 2 (1987) (aka &quot;Project A: Part 2&quot;), Police Story 2 (1988) (aka &quot;Police Story 2&quot;), The Canton Godfather (1989) (aka &quot;Mr. Canton and Lady Rose)&quot;, Fei ying gai wak (1991) (aka &quot;Armour of God 2&quot;) and Ging chaat goo si III: Chiu kup ging chaat (1992) (aka &quot;Police Story 3&quot;) were all sizable hits for Jackie, escalating his status to phenomenal heights in Asia, and to his loyal fan base around the globe. US success was now just around the corner for the the hard-working Jackie Chan, and it arrived in the form of the action film Terremoto nel Bronx (1995) (aka &quot;Rumble In The Bronx&quot;, though it was actually filmed in Canada) that successfully blended humor and action to make a winning formula in US theaters.Jackie did not waste any time and went to work on First Strike (1996) (aka &quot;Police Story 4&quot;), Mr. Nice Guy (1997) (aka &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot;), Senza nome e senza regole (1998) (aka &quot;Who Am I&quot;), which all met with positive results at the international box office. Jackie then went to work in the his biggest-budget US production, starring alongside fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker in the action / comedy Rush Hour - Due mine vaganti (1998). The film was a bigger hit than &quot;Rumble In the Bronx&quot; and firmly established Jackie as a bona fide star in the US. Jackie then paired up with rising talent Owen Wilson to star in Pallottole cinesi (2000) and its sequel, 2 cavalieri a Londra (2003), and re-teamed with Tucker in Colpo grosso al drago rosso - Rush Hour 2 (2001), as well as starring in Lo smoking (2002), The Medallion (2003) and the delightful Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (2004). Not one to forget his loyal fan base, Jackie returned to more gritty and traditional fare with New Police Story (2004) (aka &quot;New Police Story&quot;) and The myth - Il risveglio di un eroe (2005) (aka &quot;The Myth&quot;). The multi-talented Chan (he&apos;s also a major recording star in Asia) shows no sign of slowing down and has long since moved out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, to whom he was usually compared early in his career.Chan is truly one of the international film industry&apos;s true maverick actor / director / stuntman / producer combinations - he has done it the hard way, and always his way to achieve his dreams and goals to be an international cinematic star. Off screen he has been directly involved in many philanthropic ventures providing financial assistance to schools and universities around the world. He is a UNICEF GoodWill Ambassador, and he has campaigned against animal abuse and pollution and assisted with disaster relief efforts to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of Broadway and Hollywood&apos;s cleverer talents who tends to shine a smart, cynical light on her surroundings, Stockard Channing was born Susan Williams Antonia Stockard on February 13, 1944 in New York City, to a Catholic family with English and Irish ancestry. Her parents were Mary Alice (nee English) and well-to-do shipping executive Lester Napier Stockard; the latter died when his daughter was 16 and left her a sizable estate. She grew up in Brooklyn and attended the eminent Chapin School in NYC, then later attended the Madeira School, a girls&apos; boarding school in Virginia. She majored in both literature and history at Radcliffe College, from which she graduated summa cum laude in 1965. In 1964 she married the first of her four husbands, Walter Channing Jr., a businessman whose surname she kept for part of her own stage moniker after their divorce four years later.Stockard made her stage debut in a production of &quot;The Investigation&quot; at the experimental Theatre Company of Boston in 1966. She went on to play a number of offbeat roles with the company. She eventually migrated to New York where she took her first Broadway bow as a chorus member and understudy in the musical version of &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; in 1971. Two years later she would take over the prime role of Julia in the L.A. national company. Other theater roles during this time included &quot;Adaptation/Next&quot; (1970) &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1970), &quot;Play Strindberg&quot; (1971) and &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot; (1973).Somewhat plaintive yet unique-looking, the dark-haired actress began first appearing in pictures with small parts in the dark comedy Anche i dottori ce l&apos;hanno (1971) and the edgy Barbra Streisand fantasy-drama Voglio la libertÃ  (1972). Taking on the top female lead as an heiress and potential victim of shysters Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty in Mike Nichols&apos; comedy Due uomini e una dote (1975), the film, despite its male star power, would not become the star-making hit for Channing as initially hoped and Channing. Her next two films (Il fantabus (1976) and Sweet Revenge (1976)) faded away even quicker. Earlier, however, she hit a home with the TV-movie Una ragazza molto brutta (1973), a clever black comedy written by Joan Rivers wherein Stockard played a former ugly duckling-turned-beauty (Ã  la plastic surgery) who knocks off the men who formerly mistreated her. This was Channing at her smart and cynical best, traits that would carry her far in Hollywood.At age 33(!), she was handed the feisty role of high-school teen Betty Rizzo in the box-office film version of the hit musical Grease - Brillantina (1978), starring Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. While long in the tooth for such a role (as were others), Stockard&apos;s sly performance earned her the People&apos;s Choice Awards for Favorite Motion Picture Supporting Actress. This popular film clinched her place as a top-ranking contender.As a result, she was handed two sitcom vehicles within a year on CBS: Stockard Channing in Just Friends (1979), as a newly-separated wife starting life anew in another city (L.A.), and The Stockard Channing Show (1980), which again cast her as a divorced lady trying to find herself again in L.A. Neither made her a TV star. Both failed to catch on and lasted but a few months. Stalled at a critical juncture in her career, Stockard decided to return to her first love -- the theater. With &quot;Vanities&quot;, &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot; (as Rosalind) already on her resume, she earned fine notices on Broadway with the musical &quot;They&apos;re Playing Our Song&quot; replacing Lucie Arnaz in 1980, then garnered rave reviews in the part of the mother of a developmentally disabled child in the New Haven production of Peter Nichols&apos; &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; in 1982. She repeated her role on Broadway a few years later (the title now shortened to &quot;Joe Egg&quot;) and copped the 1985 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Subsequent Tony nominations came her way for her offbeat work in &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; (1986); 6 gradi di separazione (1993) (for which she also won an Off-Broadway Obie), &quot;Four Baboons Adoring the Sun&quot; (1992); and for her Eleanor of Aquitaine in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; in 1999.Award-worthy projects came her way on TV as well. Nominated for an Emmy for the CBS miniseries Echoes in the Darkness (1987), she also won a CableACE Award for her work in Tidy Endings (1988). In film, she received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations when her stage triumph, 6 gradi di separazione (1993), was turned into a film and also received the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress in the film The Business of Strangers (2001) .In 1999, Stockard became a recurring member of the cast of West Wing - Tutti gli uomini del Presidente (1999) as First Lady Abigail Bartlet. Audiences were so drawn to her shrewd, classy character that producers wisely started featuring her regularly into the third season. In 2002 she won both Emmy and SAG awards for this role, as well as a second Emmy that same year for her supporting turn as Judy Sheppard in The Matthew Shepard Story (2002), a docudrama about the gay-bashing murder of young Matthew Shepard. Stockard thought she finally found sitcom success with the series Out of Practice - Medici senza speranza (2005) and was even Emmy-nominated for her role as a sharp-tongued but caring doctor. As luck would have it, she again couldn&apos;t find a core audience and the show lasted but a mere season.Stockard continues to excel in sly, worldly roles that combine a dark wit with an even darker cynical edge. True to form, she recently completed a picture aptly titled Multiple Sarcasms (2010). Divorced four times, including one to writer/producer David Debin, she has no children. She has been in a long-term relationship with cinematographer Daniel Gillham since 1988. Her sister Lesly Stockard Smith became mayor of Palm Beach in 2000.</rdfs:comment>

His parents both came from prominent families, and his grandfathers were artist and illustrator Edward Leigh Chase and admiral Miles Browning. His recent ancestry includes English, Scottish, Irish, and Danish.His grandmother gave him the nickname &quot;Chevy&quot; when he was two years old. Chase was a part of the Il Saturday Night Live (1975) cast from its debut until 1976, and then embarked on a highly successful movie career. He scored in the eighties with hits such as Palla da golf (1980), National Lampoon&apos;s Vacation (1983) and its sequels, Fletch - Un colpo da prima pagina (1985) and Fletch - Cronista d&apos;assalto (1989). All his films show his talent for deadpan comedy. Sadly, his career generally worsened throughout the nineties, starring in disappointments such as the mediocre Avventure di un uomo invisibile (1992), and Poliziotti a domicilio (1994). More recently, Community (2009) marked a return for him, as he played a regular role for the first four seasons.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The beat goes on ... and on ... and as strong as ever for this superstar entertainer who has well surpassed the four-decade mark while improbably transforming herself from an artificial, glossy &quot;flashionplate&quot; singer into a serious, Oscar-worthy, dramatic actress ... and back again! With more ups and downs than the 2008 Dow Jones Industrial Average, Cher managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes each time she was down, somehow re-inventing herself with every decade and finding herself on top all over again. As a singer Cher is the only performer to have earned &quot;top 10&quot; hit singles in four consecutive decades; as an actress, she and Barbra Streisand are the only two Best Actress Oscar winners to have a #1 hit song on the Billboard charts. At age 62, Cher has yet to decide to get completely off her fabulous roller coaster ride, although she has threatened to on occasion.The daughter of Arkansas-born Georgia Holt (the former Jackie Jean Crouch) and truck driver John Sarkisian, Cher was born in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. She has a sister, Georganne LaPiere. Cher is of Armenian heritage on her father&apos;s side, and of English and German, with more distant Irish, Dutch, and French, heritage on her mother&apos;s side. The father deserted the family when Cher was young, and her mother later married banker Gilbert LaPiere. Her mother, who aspired to be an actress and model, paid for Cher&apos;s acting classes. Cher had undiagnosed dyslexia, which acutely affected her studies; frustrated, she quit Fresno High School at 16 to pursue her dream. At that time, she had a brief relationship with actor Warren Beatty.In 1962 Cher&apos;s life changed forever when she met the older-by-11-years Sonny Bono. He was working for record-producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood and managed to persuade Spector to hire Cher as a session singer, and she recorded backup vocals on Spector classics like &quot;You&apos;ve Lost That Lovin&apos; Feelin&apos;&quot; and &quot;Be My Baby.&quot; The couple&apos;s relationship evolved and they married on October 27, 1964.At first Cher sang solo with Sonny behind the scenes writing, arranging and producing her songs. When the records went nowhere, Sonny decided they needed to perform as a team so they put out two songs in 1964 under the recording names of Caesar and Cleo (&quot;The Letter&quot; and &quot;Baby Don&apos;t Go&quot;). Again, no success. The changing of their names, however, made a difference and in 1965, they officially took on the music world as Sonny &amp; Cher and earned instant rewards.The now 19-year-old Cher and 30-year-old Sonny became huge hits following the release of their first album, &quot;Look at Us&quot; (summer, 1965), which contained the hit single &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. With the song catapulting to #1, they decided to re-release their earlier single &quot;Baby Don&apos;t Go&quot;, and it also raced up the charts to #8. An assembly line of mild hits dotted the airwaves over the next year or two, culminating in the huge smash hit &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; (#6, 1967). Between 1965 and 1972 Sonny &amp; Cher charted a total of six &quot;Top 10&quot; hits.The kooky couple became icons of the late &apos;60s &quot;flower power&quot; scene, wearing garish garb and outlandish hairdos and makeup. However, they found a way to make it trendy and were embraced around the world. TV musical variety and teen pop showcases relished their contrasting styles -- the short, excitable, mustachioed, nasal-toned simpleton and the taller, exotic, unflappable fashion maven. They found a successful formula with their repartee, which became a central factor in their live concert shows, even more than their singing. With all this going on, Sonny still endeavored to promote Cher as a solo success. Other than such hits with &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot; (#16) and &quot;Bang, Bang&quot; (#2), she struggled to find a separate identity. Sonny even arranged film projects for her but Good Times (1967), an offbeat fantasy starring the couple and directed by future powerhouse William Friedkin, and Cher&apos;s serious solo effort Chastity (1969) both flickered out and died a quick death.By the end of the 1960s, Sonny &amp; Cher&apos;s career had stumbled as they witnessed the American pop culture experience a drastic evolutionary change. The couple maintained their stage act and all the while Sonny continued to polish it up in a shrewd gamble for TV acceptance. While Sonny on stage played the ineffectual object of Cher&apos;s stinging barbs on stage, he was actually the highly motivated mastermind off stage and, amazingly enough, his foresight and chutzpah really paid off. Although the couple had lost favor with the new 70s generation, Sonny encouraged TV talent scouts to catch their live act.The network powers-that-be saw potential in the duo as they made a number of guest TV appearances in specials and on variety and talk shows and in what was essentially &quot;auditioning&quot; for their own TV vehicle. The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour (1971) was given the green light as a summer replacement series and was an instant sensation when it earned its own time spot that fall season. The show received numerous Emmy Award nominations during its run and the couple became stars all over again. Their lively, off-the-wall comedy sketch routines, her outrÃ© Bob Mackie fashions and their harmless, edgy banter were the highlights of the hour-long program. Audiences took strongly to the couple who appeared to have a deep-down sturdy relationship. Their daughter Chaz Bono occasionally added to the couple&apos;s loving glow on the show. Cher&apos;s TV success also generated renewed interest in her as a solo recording artist and she came up with three #1 hits during this time (&quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves,&quot; &quot;Half-Breed&quot; and &quot;Dark Lady&quot;).Behind the scenes, though, it was a different story. A now-confident Cher yearned to be free of husband Sonny&apos;s Svengali-like control over her life and career. The marriage split at the seams in 1974 and they publicly announced their separation. The show, which had earned Cher a Golden Globe Award, took a fast tumble as the separation and divorce grew more acrimonious. Eventually they both tried to launch their own solo variety shows, but both failed to even come close to their success as a duo. Audiences weren&apos;t interested in Cher without Sonny, and vice versa.In late June of 1975, only three days after the couple&apos;s divorce, Cher married rock musician Gregg Allman of The Allman Brothers Band. That marriage imploded rather quickly amid reports of out-of-control drug use on his part. They were divorced by 1977 with only one bright outcome -- son Elijah Allman.In 1976 Sonny and Cher attempted to &quot;make up&quot; again, this time to the tune of a second The Sonny and Cher Show (1976). Audiences, however, did not accept the &quot;friendly&quot; divorced couple after so much tabloid nastiness. After the initial curiosity factor wore off, the show was canceled amid poor ratings. Moreover, the musical variety show format was on its way out as well. Once again, another decade was looking to end badly for Cher.Cher found a mild success with the &quot;top 10&quot; disco hit &quot;Take Me Home&quot; in 1979, but not much else. Not one to be counted out, however, the ever resourceful singer decided to lay back and focus on acting instead. At age 36, Cher made her Broadway debut in 1982 in what was essentially her first live acting role with &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;. Centering around a reunion of girlfriends from an old James Dean fan club, her performance was critically lauded. This earned her the right to transfer her stage triumph to film alongside Karen Black and Sandy Dennis. Cher earned critical raves for Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982), her first film role since 1969.With film #2 came a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for her portrayal of a lesbian toiling in a nuclear parts factory in Silkwood (1983), starring Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell. This in turn was followed by her star turn in Dietro la maschera (1985) as the blunt, footloose mother of a son afflicted with a rare disease (played beautifully by Eric Stoltz). Once again Cher received high praise and copped a win from the Cannes Film Festival for her poignant performance.Fully accepted by this time as an actress of high-caliber, she integrated well into the Hollywood community. Proving that she could hold up a film outright, she was handed three hit vehicles to star in: Le streghe di Eastwick (1987), Suspect - Presunto colpevole (1987), and Stregata dalla luna (1987), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Along with all this newfound Hollywood celebrity came interest in her as a singer and recording artist again. &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time (#3) and the Peter Cetera duet &quot;After All&quot; (#6) placed her back on the Billboard charts.During the 1990s Cher continued to veer back and forth among films, TV specials and expensively mounted concerts. In January of 1998, tragedy struck when Cher&apos;s ex-husband Sonny Bono, who had forsaken an entertainment career for California politics and became a popular Republican congressman in the process, was killed in a freak skiing accident. That same year the duo received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contribution to television. In the meantime an astounding career adrenaline rush came in the form of a monstrous, disco-flavored hit single (&quot;Believe&quot;). The song became a #1 hit and the same-titled album the biggest hit of her career. &quot;Believe&quot; reached #1 in 23 different countries.Having little to prove anymore to anyone, Cher decided to embark on a &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; in the early part of the millennium and, after much stretching, her show finally closed in 2005 in Los Angeles. It didn&apos;t take long, however, for Cher to return from this self-imposed exile. In 2008, she finalized a deal with Las Vegas&apos; Caesars Palace for the next three years to play the Colosseum, and has since returned live on numerous &quot;farewell&quot; tour extravaganzas. Never say never. Cher looked like she was going to returned films with her co-starring role opposite Christina Aguilera in Burlesque (2010), but has since only provided a glitzy cameo in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018).In other facets of her life, Cher has been involved with many humanitarian groups and charity efforts over the years, particularly her work as National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson of the Children&apos;s Craniofacial Association, which was inspired by her work in Dietro la maschera (1985).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Chow Yun Fat is a charismatic, athletically built and energetic Asian-born film star who first came to the attention of western audiences via his roles in the high-octane/blazing guns action films of maverick HK director John Woo.Chow was born in 1955 on the quiet island of Lamma, part of the then-British colony of Hong Kong, near its famous Victoria Harbour. His mother was a vegetable farmer and cleaning lady, and his father worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker. Chow&apos;s family moved to urban Hong Kong in 1965 and in early 1973, Chow attended a casting call for TVB, a division of Shaw Bros. productions. With his good looks and easy-going style, Chow was originally a heartthrob actor in non-demanding TV and film roles. However, his popularity increased with his appearance as white-suited gangster Hui Man-Keung in the highly popular drama TV series Shang Hai tan (1980).In 1985, Chow started receiving acclaim for his work and scored the Golden Horse (Best Actor) Award in Taiwan and another Best Actor Award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival for his performance in Dang doi lai ming (1984). With these accolades, Chow came to the attention of Woo, who cast Chow in the fast-paced gangster film A Better Tomorrow (1986) (aka &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;). The rest, as they say, is history. The film was an enormous commercial success, and Chow&apos;s influence on young Asian males was not dissimilar to the adulation given to previous Asian film sensations such as Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Nearly every young guy in Hong Kong ran out and bought himself a &quot;Mark Coat,&quot; as they became known--a long, heavy woolen coat worn by Chow in the movie (although it is is actually very unsuited to Hong Kong&apos;s hot and humid climate).Further hard-edged roles in more John Woo crime films escalated Chow&apos;s popularity even higher, and fans all over the world flocked to see A Better Tomorrow II (1987) (aka &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot;), The Killer (1989) (aka &quot;The Killer&quot;), and Hard Boiled (1992) (aka &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;). With the phenomenal global interest in the HK action genre, Chow was enticed to the United States and appeared in Costretti ad uccidere (1998) with Mira Sorvino, The Corruptor - Indagine a Chinatown (1999) with Mark Wahlberg, and, for a change of pace, in the often-filmed romantic tale of Anna and the King (1999).Chow then returned to the Asian cinema circuit and starred in the critically lauded kung fu epic La tigre e il dragone (2000) (aka &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;). His wide appeal can be seen in his &quot;boy next door&quot; type of personality and his ability to play such a broad spectrum of roles from a comedic buffoon to a lovestruck Romeo to a trigger-happy professional killer. A highly entertaining and gifted actor with dynamic on-screen presence, Chow continues to remain in strong demand in many film markets.</rdfs:comment>

She is the daughter of Bettine (Moore) and William Taliaferro Close (William Close), a prominent doctor. Both of her parents were from upper-class northeastern families.Glenn was often seen on Broadway until 1982 when she was cast in her award winning role as Jenny Fields in Il mondo secondo Garp (1982) alongside Robin Williams. For this role, a breakthrough in film for Close, she later went on to receive an Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The following year she was cast in the hit comedy Il grande freddo (1983) for which she received a second Oscar Nomination, once again for Supporting Actress in the role of Sarah Cooper. In her third film, Close portrayed Iris Gaines a former lover of baseball player Roy Hobbs portrayed by Robert Redford, in one of the greatest sports films of all time, Il migliore (1984). For a third and final time, Close was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Close went on to star in films like The Stone Boy (1984), Maxie (1985) and Doppio taglio (1985). In 1987 Close was cast in the box office hit Attrazione fatale (1987) for which she portrayed deranged stalker Alex Forrest alongside costars Michael Douglas and Anne Archer. For this role she was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress. The following year Close starred in the Oscar Winning Drama Le relazioni pericolose (1988) for which she portrayed one of the most classic roles of all time as Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil, starring alongside John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. For this role she was nominated once again for the Academy Award and BAFTA Film Award for Best Actress. Close was favorite to win the coveted statue but lost to Jodie Foster for Sotto accusa (1988). Close had her claim to fame in the 1980s. Close starred on the hit Drama series Damages (2007) for which she has won a Golden Globe Award and two Emmy Awards. In her career Close has been Oscar nominated seven times, won three Tonys, an Obie, three Emmys, two Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Lanky, charismatic and versatile actor with an amazing grin that put everyone at ease, James Coburn studied acting at UCLA, and then moved to New York to study under noted acting coach Stella Adler. After being noticed in several stage productions, Coburn appeared in a handful of minor westerns before being cast as the knife-throwing, quick-shooting Britt in the John Sturges mega-hit I magnifici sette (1960). Sturges remembered Coburn&apos;s talents when he cast his next major film project, La grande fuga (1963), where Coburn played the Australian POW Sedgwick. Regular work now came thick and fast for Coburn, including appearing in Sierra Charriba (1965), the first of several films he appeared in directed by Hollywood enfant terrible Sam Peckinpah.Coburn was then cast, and gave an especially fine performance as Lt. Commander Paul Cummings in Arthur Hiller&apos;s The Americanization of Emily, where he demonstrated a flair for writer Paddy Chayefsky&apos;s subtle, ironic comedy that would define his performances for the rest of his career.The next two years were a key period for Coburn, with his performances in the wonderful 007 spy spoof Il nostro agente Flint (1966) and the eerie Alle donne piace ladro (1966). Coburn followed up in 1967 with a Flint sequel, A noi piace Flint (1967), and the much underrated political satire La folle impresa del dottor Schaefer (1967). The remainder of the 1960s was rather uneventful for Coburn. However, he became associated with martial arts legend Bruce Lee and the two trained together, traveled extensively and even visited India scouting locations for a proposed film project, but Lee&apos;s untimely death (Coburn, along with Steve McQueen, was a pallbearer at Lee&apos;s funeral) put an end to that.The 1970s saw Coburn appearing again in several strong roles, starting off in Peckinpah&apos;s Pat Garrett e Billy Kid (1973), alongside Charles Bronson in the Depression-era L&apos;eroe della strada (1975) and as a disenchanted German soldier on the Russian front in Peckinpah&apos;s superb La croce di ferro (1977). Towards the end of the decade, however, Coburn was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, which severely hampered his health and work output for many years. After conventional treatments failed, Coburn turned to a holistic therapist, and through a restructured diet program, made a definite improvement. By the 1990s he was once again appearing regularly in both film and TV productions.No one was probably more surprised than Coburn himself when he was both nominated for, and then won, the Best Supporting Actor Award in 1997 for playing Nick Nolte&apos;s abusive and alcoholic father in Affliction (1997). At 70 years of age, Coburn&apos;s career received another shot in the arm, and he appeared in another 14 films, including Snow Dogs - 8 cani sotto zero (2002) and L&apos;ultimo gigolÃ² (2001), before his death from a heart attack in November of 2002. Coburn&apos;s passions in life included martial arts, card-playing and enjoying Cuban cigars (which may have contributed to his fatal heart attack).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Minneapolis native Rachael Leigh Cook began her career as a model at the tender age of 10, gracing Milk-Bone(R) boxes and Target(R) ads nationwide in the USA. She also appeared in a now-famous (in the USA) anti-drug TV spot in which, armed with a frying pan, she bashed her way through a kitchen to show the disastrous effects of heroin. At 14, her modeling agency sent her to read for a short film (26 Summer Street (1996)) and changed the course of her young life--from that moment on, Cook was hooked on acting. When she reached L.A. later that year, Cook bypassed the wannabe stage and nailed her first audition (for the part of a budding entrepreneur in Il club delle baby sitter (1995)). She returned to theaters three months later in the Jonathan Taylor Thomas vehicle Le avventure di Tom Sawyer e Huck Finn (1995), then filled her calendar with appearances in independent and made-for-TV movies. She divided her time between Minneapolis and Tinseltown, shuttling from school events to movie shoots with her mother in tow. Cook&apos;s starlet status crystallized in 1999, when she starred opposite Freddie Prinze Jr. in the Pygmalion retelling Kiss Me (1999). Her on-screen transformation from ugly duckling to ravishing beauty scored several teen-oriented awards and made Cook a hot commodity in Hollywood. She signed for a handful of plum follow-up roles, including a troubled adolescent in Sylvester Stallone&apos;s La vendetta di Carter (2000), a frontier gal in Texas Rangers (2001), and the caterwauling lead in the live-action version of Josie and the Pussycats (2001). Cook now lives primarily in Los Angeles, but she returns home frequently to visit with friends and family. Her father, Tom (a former stand-up comic), is a social worker in the public school system, and her younger brother, Ben, is an aspiring filmmaker.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Francis Ford Coppola was born in 1939 in Detroit, Michigan, but grew up in a New York suburb in a creative, supportive Italian-American family. His father, Carmine Coppola, was a composer and musician. His mother, Italia Coppola (nÃ©e Pennino), had been an actress. Francis Ford Coppola graduated with a degree in drama from Hofstra University, and did graduate work at UCLA in filmmaking. He was training as assistant with filmmaker Roger Corman, working in such capacities as sound-man, dialogue director, associate producer and, eventually, director of Terrore alla 13Âª ora (1963), Coppola&apos;s first feature film. During the next four years, Coppola was involved in a variety of script collaborations, including writing an adaptation of &quot;This Property is Condemned&quot; by Tennessee Williams (with Fred Coe and Edith Sommer), and screenplays for Parigi brucia? (1966) and Patton, generale d&apos;acciaio (1970), the film for which Coppola won a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. In 1966, Coppola&apos;s 2nd film brought him critical acclaim and a Master of Fine Arts degree. In 1969, Coppola and George Lucas established American Zoetrope, an independent film production company based in San Francisco. The company&apos;s first project was L&apos;uomo che fuggÃ¬ dal futuro (1971), produced by Coppola and directed by Lucas. Coppola also produced the second film that Lucas directed, American Graffiti (1973), in 1973. This movie got five Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. In 1971, Coppola&apos;s film Il padrino (1972) became one of the highest-grossing movies in history and brought him an Oscar for writing the screenplay with Mario Puzo The film was a Best Picture Academy Award-winner, and also brought Coppola a Best Director Oscar nomination. Following his work on the screenplay for Il grande Gatsby (1974), Coppola&apos;s next film was La conversazione (1974), which was honored with the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and brought Coppola Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations. Also released that year, Il padrino - Parte II (1974), rivaled the success of Il padrino (1972), and won six Academy Awards, bringing Coppola Oscars as a producer, director and writer. Coppola then began work on his most ambitious film, Apocalypse Now (1979), a Vietnam War epic that was inspired by Joseph Conrad&apos;s Cuore di tenebra (1993). Released in 1979, the acclaimed film won a Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and two Academy Awards. Also that year, Coppola executive produced the hit Black Stallion (1979). With George Lucas, Coppola executive produced Kagemusha - L&apos;ombra del guerriero (1980), directed by Akira Kurosawa, and Mishima: Una vita in quattro capitoli (1985), directed by Paul Schrader and based on the life and writings of Yukio Mishima. Coppola also executive produced such films as 60 minuti per Danny Masters (1982), Hammett: indagine a Chinatown (1982) Il ritorno di Black Stallion (1983), Barfly - Moscone da bar (1987), Wind - piÃ¹ forte del vento (1992), Il giardino segreto (1993), etc.He helped to make a star of his nephew, Nicolas Cage.

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1926-04-05</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Roger William Corman was born April 5, 1926, in Detroit, Michigan. Initially following in his father&apos;s footsteps, Corman studied engineering at Stanford University but while in school, he began to lose interest in the profession and developed a growing passion for film. Upon graduation, he worked a total of three days as an engineer at US Electrical Motors, which cemented his growing realization that engineering wasn&apos;t for him. He quit and took a job as a messenger for 20th Century Fox, eventually rising to the position of story analyst.After a term spent studying modern English literature at England&apos;s Oxford University and a year spent bopping around Europe, Corman returned to the US, intent on becoming a screenwriter/producer. He sold his first script in 1953, &quot;The House in the Sea,&quot; which was eventually filmed and released as FBI operazione Las Vegas (1954).Horrified by the disconnect between his vision for the project and the film that eventually emerged, Corman took his salary from the picture, scraped together a little capital and set himself up as a producer, turning out Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954). Corman used his next picture, The Fast and the Furious (1954), to finagle a multi-picture deal with a fledgling company called American Releasing Corp. (ARC). It would soon change its name to American-International Pictures (AIP) and with Corman as its major talent behind the camera, would become one of the most successful independent studios in cinema history.With no formal training, Corman first took to the director&apos;s chair with Cinque colpi di pistola (1955) and over the next 15 years directed 53 films, mostly for AIP. He proved himself a master of quick, inexpensive productions, turning out several movies as director and/or producer in each of those years--nine movies in 1957, and nine again in 1958. His personal speed record was set with The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), which he shot in two days and a night.In the early 1960s he began to take on more ambitious projects, gaining a great deal of critical praise (and commercial success) from a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories, most of them starring Vincent Price. His film L&apos;odio esplode a Dallas (1962) was a serious look at racial integration in the South, starring a very young William Shatner. Critically praised and winning a prize at the Venice Film Festival, the movie became Corman&apos;s first--and, for many years, only--commercial flop. He called its failure &quot;the greatest disappointment in my career.&quot; As a consequence of the experience, Corman opted to avoid such direct &quot;message&quot; films in the future and resolved to express his social and political concerns beneath the surface of overt entertainments.Those messages became more radical as the 1960s wound to a close and after AIP began re-editing his films without his knowledge or consent, he left the company, retiring from directing to concentrate on production and distribution through his own newly formed company, New World Pictures. In addition to low-budget exploitation flicks, New World also distributed distinguished art cinema from around the world, becoming the American distributor for the films of Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Federico Fellini, FranÃ§ois Truffaut and others. Selling off New World in the 1980s, Corman has continued his work through various companies in the years since--Concorde Pictures, New Horizons, Millenium Pictures, New Concorde. In 1990, after the publication of his biography &quot;How I Made A Hundred Movies in Hollywood And Never Lost A Dime&quot;--one of the all-time great books on filmmaking--he returned to directing but only for a single film, Frankenstein oltre le frontiere del tempo (1990)With hundreds of movies to his credit, Roger Corman is one of the most prolific producers in the history of the film medium and one of the most successful--in his nearly six decades in the business, only about a dozen of his films have failed to turn a profit. Corman has been dubbed, among other things, &quot;The King of the Cult Film&quot; and &quot;The Pope of Pop Cinema&quot; and his filmography is packed with hundreds of remarkably entertaining films in addition to dozens of genuine cult classics. Corman has displayed an unrivaled eye for talent over the years--it could almost be said that it would be easier to name the top directors, actors, writers and creators in Hollywood who DIDN&apos;T get their start with him than those who did. Among those he mentored are Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, James Cameron, Robert De Niro, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante and Sandra Bullock. His influence on modern American cinema is almost incalculable. In 2009 he was honored with an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David Cronenberg, also known as the King of Venereal Horror or the Baron of Blood, was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1943. His father, Milton Cronenberg, was a journalist and editor, and his mother, Esther (Sumberg), was a piano player. After showing an inclination for literature at an early age (he wrote and published eerie short stories, thus following his father&apos;s path) and for music (playing classical guitar until he was 12), Cronenberg graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Literature after switching from the science department. He reached the cult status of horror-meister with the gore-filled, modern-vampire variations of Il demone sotto la pelle (1975) and Rabid - Sete di sangue (1977), following an experimental apprenticeship in independent film-making and in Canadian television programs.Cronenberg gained popularity with the head-exploding, telepathy-based Scanners (1981) after the release of the much underrated, controversial, and autobiographical Brood - La covata malefica (1979). Cronenberg become a sort of a mass media guru with Videodrome (1983), a shocking investigation of the hazards of reality-morphing television and a prophetic critique of contemporary aesthetics. The issues of tech-induced mutation of the human body and topics of the prominent dichotomy between body and mind were back again in La zona morta (1983) and La mosca (1986), both bright examples of a personal film-making identity, even if both films are based on mass-entertainment materials: the first being a rendition of a Stephen King best-seller, the latter a remake of a famous American horror movie.With Inseparabili (1988) and Il pasto nudo (1991), the Canadian director, no more a mere genre movie-maker but a fully realized auteur, got the acclaim of international critics. Such profound statements on modern humanity and ever-changing society are prominent in the provocative Crash (1996) and in the virtual reality essay of eXistenZ (1999), both of which well fared at the Cannes and Berlin Film Festivals. In the last two film projects Spider (2002) and A History of Violence (2005), Cronenberg avoids expressing his teratologic and oniric expressionism in favor of a more psychological exploration of human contradictions and idiosyncrasies.</rdfs:comment>

Forming part of the extensive Crosby family dynasty, this striking leading actress, daughter of entertainer Dennis Crosby, has appeared in film and television since the early 1980s. A photo spread in a 1979 issue of Playboy magazine and a role in the soap opera Il tempo della nostra vita (1965) in 1980 allowed Denise to break through to stardom. She had a small role in 48 ore (1982), playing the villain&apos;s girlfriend, and parts in Sulle orme della pantera rosa (1982) and Pantera rosa - Il mistero Clouseau (1983) (both critically unsuccessful). Her career began to pick up in the mid-1980s. She appeared in a variety of films and made-for-TV movies, including Stark - Luci sfolgoranti (1985), Malice in Wonderland (1985) (playing Carole Lombard), Cuori nel deserto (1985), Eliminators (1986) and Soluzione finale (1988).In 1987, Denise caught her big break playing Lieutenant Tasha Yar in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). Although not a huge role, the character allowed Denise to build a sizable fan base that exists to this day. In 1988, she left the series due to the diminishing size of her role, but returned as a guest star in the early 1990s. In 1989, she played the mother of a dead toddler who was brought back to life through an ancient curse in Stephen King&apos;s somewhat hokey horror novel film adaptation Cimitero vivente (1989). Remaining in the horror genre, Denise played a similar role of a mother who discovers her young daughter&apos;s doll is evil in the La bambola assassina (1988) clone La bambola che uccide (1991).The 1990s brought few opportunities to Denise, but she worked consistently, appearing in a television series in 1993, and made numerous guest appearances, including a couple of episodes of the raunchy cable series Orchidea selvaggia 3 (1992), which were subsequently released on video. There were also roles in Sotto controllo (1994), Mutant Species (1995), Premonizione omicida (1995) and Morte alla Casa Bianca (1997). More high-profile work arrived in the form of a small role in Jackie Brown (1997), playing a public defender, and a sizable part as a pregnant mother in the hit disaster movie Deep Impact (1998). She gained recognition as a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan by producing and presenting Trekkies (1997) and its sequel Trekkies 2 (2004).Since 2000, Denise has appeared on television in guest roles on X-Files (1993), JAG - Avvocati in divisa (1995), The Agency (2001), Codice Matrix (2003), Eyes (2005) and Dexter (2006). She acted in the award-winning short film The Bus Stops Here (2003), had a leading role in the western/horror indie film Legend of the Phantom Rider (2002) and has recently appeared in a horror film by legendary genre director Tobe Hooper, Il custode (2005). This capable actress continues to appear on television and in film. Best known for her &quot;Star Trek&quot; days, Denise embraces her fans often at conventions and was appearing opposite her husband Ken Sylk in the drama film Ripple Effect (2007).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1948-03-14</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Billy Crystal was born on March 14, 1948 in Long Beach, Long Island, New York. He is the youngest of three sons born to Helen (Gabler) and Jack Crystal. His father was a well-known concert promoter who co-founded Commodore Records and his mother was a homemaker. His family were Jewish immigrants from Russia, Austria, and Lithuania. With his father in the music business, Billy was no stranger to some of the top performers of the time. Legends such as Billie Holiday, Pee Wee Russell, and Eddie Condon regularly stopped by the Crystal household. At age 15, Billy faced a personal tragedy when his father died of a heart attack at the relatively young age of 54. This gave Billy a real appreciation of what his dad was able to accomplish while alive and what his mother did to keep the family together. Despite this tragedy, Billy was very upbeat and likable as a kid. He had a unique talent for making people laugh. With television becoming a new medium, Billy got his influence from shows like The Honeymooners (1955), and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and performers like Alan King, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters. He started doing stand-up comedy at the age of 16. However, his real dream was to be a professional baseball player. His idol growing up was Yankees outfielder Mickey Mantle. He spent long hours in the summers playing softball in the middle of Park Avenue with his brothers and his father, a former pitcher at St. John&apos;s University . At Long Beach High, Billy played second base and was varsity captain in his senior year. This earned him a baseball scholarship from Marshall University in West Virginia which he accepted. However, he would never end up playing a game as the baseball program was suspended during his freshman year. This would lead him to leave the university and move back to New York. He then enrolled at nearby Nassau Community College, majoring in theater. It was there that he met and fell in love with a dancer named Janice Goldfinger. They would get married in 1970 and have two daughters. Shortly after, Billy got accepted in New York University, where he majored in Film and TV Direction. While at NYU, he studied under legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He also worked as house manager and usher on a production of &quot;You&apos;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;. After receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts from NYU in 1970, Billy temporarily worked as a substitute teacher until he was able to get gigs as a stand-up comic. He formed his own improv group, 3&apos;s Company, and opened for musicians like Barry Manilow. His impression of Howard Cosell interviewing Muhammad Ali became a huge hit with the audience. He left Long Beach for Hollywood in August of 1976 in the hopes of trying to land a role on a television series. It only took a year before he got his big break when he was chosen for the role of gay character Jodie Dallas on the controversial ABC sitcom Bolle di sapone (1977). This would be the first time that an American TV show would feature an openly gay character as a regular. The show ran successfully for four seasons and helped to jump-start Billy&apos;s previously stagnant career. After Bolle di sapone (1977) ended in 1981, Billy continued to do his stand-up routine, which was now attracting a larger audience with his growing celebrity status. During this time, he made many TV guest appearances and even hosted his own short-lived variety show, The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour (1982). He became a regular on Il Saturday Night Live (1975) in 1984 where his Fernando Lamas impression with the catchphrase &quot;You Look Mahvellous&quot; was a huge hit with viewers. This would lead to appearances in feature-length films such as Una perfetta coppia di svitati (1986) and Getta la mamma dal treno (1987). In 1986, along with Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams, he started Comic Relief, an annual stand-up comedy show which helped to raise money for housing and medical care for the homeless. The show has since grown substantially with the continued support of all three comics. Billy&apos;s career would peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His roles in the blockbuster movies Harry, ti presento Sally... (1989) and Scappo dalla cittÃ  - La vita, l&apos;amore e le vacche (1991) helped to establish himself as one of Hollwood&apos;s top movie stars. This star status was further validated when he was chosen to host the annual Oscars in 1990, an honor in which he would repeat seven more times. He made his big screen directorial debut in the 1992 film Mr. sabato sera (1992), which was about a washed-up stand-up comic who refuses to retire. He also wrote, produced and starred in the film. Although the film was not a huge hit, it proved that Billy was much more than an actor and comedian. In the following years, Billy continued to act in, produce, and direct several films. He had his share of hits (Terapia e pallottole (1999), I perfetti innamorati (2001)) and some flops (Due padri di troppo (1997), My Giant (1998)). His role in as a therapist to mobster Robert De Niro in Terapia e pallottole (1999) earned him critical praise. In 2001, Billy parlayed his childhood love of baseball and Mickey Mantle into a feature film. The movie, 61* (2001), which premiered on HBO, centered on the relationship between Mantle and Roger Maris and their 1961 pursuit of Babe Ruth&apos;s home run record.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Macaulay Carson Culkin, one of the most famous American child stars, was born on August 26, 1980 in New York City, New York, USA, as the third of seven children of his father Kit Culkin (a former stage and child actor and also Macaulay&apos;s former manager) and mother Patricia Brentrup. He is the brother of Shane Culkin, Dakota Culkin, Kieran Culkin, Quinn Culkin, Christian Culkin, and Rory Culkin, most of whom have also acted. Macaulay&apos;s mother, who is from North Dakota, is of German and Norwegian descent. Macaulay&apos;s father, from Manhattan, has Irish, German, English, Swiss-German, and French ancestry.&quot;Mack&quot;, as he&apos;s known to his close friends and family, first came into showbiz at the age of 4, appearing in a string of Off-Broadway shows such as the New York City Ballet&apos;s The Nutcracker and, by 8 years-old, the films Il sogno del mare - Rocket Gibraltar (1988) and Ci penseremo domani (1989), which included him in the rare company of kids who have received rave reviews from The New Yorker and The New York Times.By the age of 9, the young actor had nearly upstaged star John Candy in Io e zio Buck (1989) (his deadpan interrogation of Candy was Buck&apos;s funniest scene). Then, in 1990, writer John Hughes turned his finished Mamma, ho perso l&apos;aereo (1990) script over to director Chris Columbus with a suggestion to consider Culkin for the lead. Though Macaulay was the first kid Columbus saw, he was skeptical about having him in the lead and saw over 200 other possible actors and he admitted that no one came as close to being as good as Culkin. By the callback interview, Mack had memorized two scenes, and Columbus was sure he found his &quot;Kevin McCallister&quot;. The movie grossed more than $285 million in the US alone, becoming one of the highest grossing movies of all time and making Macaulay Culkin one of the biggest movie stars of the time.His next big project was PapÃ , ho trovato un amico (1991) in which he played &quot;Thomas J. Sennett&quot;, a boy who seems to be allergic to everything. Despite some controversy over the ending, the film was released anyway and proved to be another hit film for Mack (and featured his very first kiss). In 1992 came Mamma, ho riperso l&apos;aereo: Mi sono smarrito a New York (1992), which grossed more than $172 million in the US alone. In 1993 came L&apos;innocenza del diavolo (1993), which was the first role to depart from his cute kid comedies. He played a murderous little demon named Henry. He got the role when his powerhouse negotiator/manager/father Kit Culkin said that he would pull Mack out of Mamma, ho riperso l&apos;aereo: Mi sono smarrito a New York (1992) unless he was given the psychotic boy lead in L&apos;innocenza del diavolo (1993). He was also given a salary of $5 million for the film.In 1994, at the age of 14, came a string of duds, Pagemaster - L&apos;avventura meravigliosa (1994), PapÃ  ti aggiusto io! (1994) and Richie Rich - Il piÃ¹ ricco del mondo (1994). He was paid $8 million for the last two, the highest salary ever paid for a child star. Many people believed Mack had lost his touch, though, because he was no longer that cute tiny kid they saw in Mamma, ho perso l&apos;aereo (1990). In 1995 his parents, who were never married, separated and started a greedy legal battle over the custody of their kids and Mack&apos;s fortune. In 1996, the young actor had reportedly said he wouldn&apos;t accept any roles until his parents settled their custody dispute. That case would not be resolved until April 1997 when Kit Culkin relinquished control to Brentrup.In 1998, Macaulay married actress Rachel Miner, but separated in 2000 because Rachel wanted to start a family and Mack wanted to get back into acting. There has been a gap of eight years since 1994&apos;s Richie Rich - Il piÃ¹ ricco del mondo (1994), and although he made a &apos;comeback&apos; on stage in 2001, appearing in a London production of &quot;Madame Melville&quot;, and also portrayed Michael Alig in Party Monster (2003); with an estimated fortune of $17 million he clearly never has to work again - if the roles don&apos;t appeal to him.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1925-06-03</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz, the eldest of three children of Helen (Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz, Jewish immigrants from Hungary. Curtis himself admits that while he had almost no formal education, he was a student of the &quot;school of hard knocks&quot; and learned from a young age that the only person who ever had his back was himself, so he learned how to take care of both himself and younger brother, Julius. Curtis grew up in poverty, as his father, Emanuel, who worked as a tailor, had the sole responsibility of providing for his entire family on his meager income. This led to constant bickering between Curtis&apos;s parents over money, and Curtis began to go to movies as a way of briefly escaping the constant worries of poverty and other family problems. The financial strain of raising two children on a meager income became so tough that in 1935, Curtis&apos;s parents decided that their children would have a better life under the care of the state and briefly had Tony and his brother admitted to an orphanage. During this lonely time, the only companion Curtis had was his brother, Julius, and the two became inseparable as they struggled to get used to this new way of life. Weeks later, Curtis&apos;s parents came back to reclaim custody of Tony and his brother, but by then Curtis had learned one of life&apos;s toughest lessons: the only person you can count on is yourself.In 1938, shortly before Tony&apos;s Bar Mitzvah, tragedy struck when Tony lost the person most important to him when his brother, Julius, was hit by a truck and killed. After that tragedy, Curtis&apos;s parents became convinced that a formal education was the best way Tony could avoid the same never-knowing-where-your-next-meal-is-coming-from life that they had known. However, Tony rejected this because he felt that learning about literary classics and algebra wasn&apos;t going to advance him in life as much as some real hands-on life experience would. He was to find that real-life experience a few years later, when he enlisted in the navy in 1942. Tony spent over two years getting that life experience doing everything from working as a crewman on a submarine tender, the USS Proteus (AS-19), to honing his future craft as an actor performing as a sailor in a stage play at the Navy Signalman School in Illinois.In 1945, Curtis was honorably discharged from the navy, and when he realized that the GI Bill would allow him to go to acting school without paying for it, he now saw that his lifelong pipe dream of being an actor might actually be achievable. Curtis auditioned for the New York Dramatic Workshop, and after being accepted on the strength of his audition piece (a scene from &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; in pantomime), Curtis enrolled in early 1947. He then began to pay his dues by appearing in a slew of stage productions, including &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. He then connected with a small theatrical agent named Joyce Selznick, who was the niece of film producer David O. Selznick. After seeing his potential, Selznick arranged an interview for Curtis to see David O. Selznick at Universal Studios, where Curtis was offered a seven-year contract. After changing his name to what he saw as an elegant, mysterious moniker--&quot;Tony Curtis&quot; (named after the novel Avorio nero (1936) by Hervey Allen and a cousin of his named Janush Kertiz)--Curtis began making a name for himself by appearing in small, offbeat roles in small-budget productions. His first notable performance was a two-minute role in Doppio gioco (1949), with Burt Lancaster, in which he makes Lancaster jealous by dancing with Yvonne De Carlo. This offbeat role resulted in Curtis&apos;s being typecast as a heavy for the next few years, such as playing a gang member in Malerba (1949).Curtis continued to build up a show reel by accepting any paying job, acting in a number of bit-part roles for the next few years. It wasn&apos;t until late 1949 that he finally got the chance to demonstrate his acting flair, when he was cast in an important role in an action western, Sierra (1950). On the strength of his performance in that movie, Curtis was finally cast in a big-budget movie, Winchester &apos;73 (1950). While he appears in that movie only very briefly, it was a chance for him to act alongside a Hollywood legend, James Stewart.As his career developed, Curtis wanted to act in movies that had social relevance, ones that would challenge audiences, so he began to appear in such movies as Spartacus (1960) and La parete di fango (1958). He was advised against appearing as the subordinate sidekick in Spartacus (1960), playing second fiddle to the equally famous Kirk Douglas. However, Curtis saw no problem with this because the two had recently acted together in dual leading roles in I vichinghi (1958).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Intriguing, inspiring, and never less than interesting -- key adjectives in describing the career of Beverly D&apos;Angelo, which has well passed the four-decade mark. Perhaps deserving better movies than she generally found herself in, she nevertheless was always an object of fascination and the one to watch...whatever the role. Hardly the shrinking violet type, Hollywood counted on her for her colorful personality, down-to-earth demeanor and scene-stealing capabilities.Beverly Heather D&apos;Angelo was born on November 15, 1951 in Columbus, Ohio, the daughter of musicians Priscilla Ruth (Smith), a violinist, and Eugene Constantino &quot;Gene&quot; D&apos;Angelo, a bass player who also managed a TV station. Her maternal grandfather, Howard Dwight Smith, was the architect who designed the Ohio (&quot;Horseshoe&quot;) Stadium at Ohio State University. Her mother had English, Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry, and her father was of Italian descent. Beverly once attended an American school in Florence, Italy.Initially drawn to art, Beverly worked as a animator/cartoonist at Hanna-Barbera Productions before moving to Canada to pursue a rock singing career, To make ends meet she worked as a session vocalist and sang anyplace she could -- from coffeehouses to topless bars. At one point the teenager was invited to join up with rockabilly legend Ronnie Hawkins. Beverly&apos;s acting career started up when she left the Hawkins band and joined the Charlottetown Festival repertory company. She was touring Canada as Ophelia in &quot;Kronborg: 1582&quot;, a rock musical version of Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; when the renowned Colleen Dewhurst caught a performance and saw promise in both Beverly and the show. Eventually musical director Gower Champion got into the mix and the show was completely revamped, becoming the rock musical &quot;Rockabye Hamlet&quot;, which made its way to Broadway in 1976. While the show itself was short-lived, Beverly&apos;s Ophelia attracted fine notices and she soon found herself on the West coast with film and TV opportunities. After this point, she seldom returned to the stage but did star alongside Ed Harris in the 1995 off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard&apos;s &quot;Simpatico&quot;, which earned her a Theatre World Award.A role in the TV miniseries Capitani e Re (1976) led to bit parts in Sentinel (1977) and in the Woody Allen classic Io e Annie (1977). A string of co-starring roles followed with Giovane amore (1977), the Clint Eastwood starrer Filo da torcere (1978) and the film adaptation of the hit counterculture musical Hair (1979). Best of all for Beverly was her powerhouse featured performance as the one-and-only Patsy Cline in the acclaimed biopic La ragazza di Nashville (1980). Both she and Oscar winner Sissy Spacek (as fellow country singer Loretta Lynn) expertly supplied their own vocals.Playing everything from tough-as-nails prostitutes, party girls and barflies to rich, prim widows and depressed, alcoholic moms, most of Beverly&apos;s output was solid during this time. Playing happening kind of gals, she customarily rose above much of the standard comedic or dramatic material given. An interesting gallery of offbeat characters came her way in a number of hit-or-miss features: Paternity (1981), Il treno piÃ¹ pazzo del mondo (1984), Il grande imbroglio (1986), A servizio ereditiera offresi (1987), High Spirits - Fantasmi da legare (1988), Intrigo mortale (1989), Caccia al testamento (1990), Il mio papÃ  Ã¨ il Papa (1991), La gatta e la volpe (1992), Jack colpo di fulmine (1994), Due teneri angioletti (1994), Merchants of Venus (1998) and Sugar Town (1999). She also sang in a few of these films.Beverly attracted mainstream notice as Chevy Chase&apos;s beleaguered wife in the comedy spoof National Lampoon&apos;s Vacation (1983) and its three sequels. Stronger roles came with such films as the English/Irish production Un amore forse due (1991) and the Neo-Nazi film American History X (1998). She was also a favorite of director John Schlesinger who used her in Crazy runners - quei pazzi pazzi sulle autostrade (1981) and La prossima vittima (1996), among others. In the spoof Pterodactyl Woman from Beverly Hills (1997), in which she served as associate producer, Beverly gamely starred as a chic Beverly Hills housewife who turns into a flying prehistoric reptile by night. Other offbeat independent filming includes Illuminata (1998), Merchants of Venus (1998), Weaver of Claybank (1915), Black Water Transit (2009), La coniglietta di casa (2008), The Paul O&apos;Grady Show: Episode #7.33 (2007), Bounty Killer (2013), Frat Pack (2018) and Dreamland (2016).On TV, Beverly scored well as matricide victim Kitty Menendez in Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills (1994) and earned an Emmy-nomination (and arguably gave the best performance) as Stella Kowalski opposite &quot;Hair&quot; co-star Treat Williams in the TV remake of A Streetcar Named Desire (1984). Other topnotch TV mini-movies included Sweet Temptation (1996) and Judgment Day: The John List Story (1993), in which she played Robert Blake&apos;s devout wife. On primetime she has been cast quite assertively in recurring parts -- she has been spotted on Law &amp; Order: UnitÃ  Speciale (1999) as a defense attorney; Entourage (2004) as a talent agent; Shooter (2016) as a national security advisor; and Insatiable (2018) as a scheming beauty contestant coach.Beverly&apos;s off-camera romantic life has been just as interesting. Following her relationship with &quot;Hair&quot; director Milos Forman, she married Lorenzo Salviati, an economics student who also was an Italian duke. She left Hollywood and lived with him in Europe, but separated after two years and returned. A six-year relationship with Irish director Neil Jordan was followed by one with Oscar-winning production designer Anton Furst; this ended tragically when, just weeks after their breakup, he committed suicide. A former union with the volatile Al Pacino produced twins Olivia and Anton, who were born in 2001.These days, Beverly&apos;s career on camera has remained secondary to the raising of her children. Occasionally she has made use of her vocal talents performing at L.A. nightclubs and with a jazz band that included brother Jeff. From time to time she still lights up the screen as a brash professional or somebody&apos;s colorful mom; whatever time she has on screen, whether major or minor, it is always welcomed and never, ever less than...interesting.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Vincent Phillip D&apos;Onofrio was born on June 30, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, to Phyllis, a restaurant manager and server, and Gene D&apos;Onofrio, a theatre production assistant and interior designer. He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D&apos;Onofrio is known as an &quot;actor&apos;s actor&quot;. The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent.His first paid role was in Off-Broadway&apos;s &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot;. He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Open Admissions&quot;, followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D&apos;Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater &amp; Film Institute. As a film actor, D&apos;Onofrio&apos;s career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Full Metal Jacket (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D&apos;Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Scelta d&apos;amore - La storia di Hilary e Victor (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash Men in Black (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar &quot;The Bug&quot;).Other films of note in which he has appeared are Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991), I protagonisti (1992), Ed Wood (1994), The Cell - La cellula (2000), Ti odio, ti lascio, ti... (2006) and Jurassic World (2015). In 1996, D&apos;Onofrio garnered critical acclaim along with co-star RenÃ©e Zellweger for Il mondo intero (1996), which he helped produce. He also made a guest appearance in Homicide, Life on the Street: The Subway (1997), where he played an accident victim who could not be rescued and was destined to die. For this performance he won an Emmy nomination. In 2000, he both produced and starred in Steal This Movie (2000), a biopic of radical leader Abbie Hoffman.In 2001, D&apos;Onofrio took the role which has likely given him his greatest public recognition: Det. Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Criminal Intent (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D&apos;Onofrio&apos;s character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Having made over one hundred films in his legendary career, Willem Dafoe is internationally respected for bringing versatility, boldness, and dare to some of the most iconic films of our time. His artistic curiosity in exploring the human condition leads him to projects all over the world, large and small, Hollywood films as well as Independent cinema.In 1979, he was given a role in Michael&apos;s Cimino&apos;s Heaven&apos;s Gate, from which he was fired. Since then, he has collaborated with directors who represent a virtual encyclopedia of modern cinema: James Wan, Robert Eggers, Sean Baker, Kenneth Branagh, Kathryn Bigelow, Sam Raimi, Alan Parker, Walter Hill, Mary Harron, Wim Wenders, Anton Corbijn, Zhang Yimou, Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, William Friedkin, Werner Herzog, Lars Von Trier, Abel Ferrara, Spike Lee, David Cronenberg, Paul Schrader, Anthony Minghella, Theo Angelopoulos, Robert Rodriguez, Phillip Noyce, Hector Babenco, John Milius, Paul Weitz, The Spierig Brothers, Andrew Stanton, Josh Boone, Dee Rees and Julian Schnabel.Dafoe has been recognized with four Academy Award nominations: Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Platoon, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Shadow Of The Vampire, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for The Florida Project, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, and most recently, Best Leading Actor for At Eternity&apos;s Gate, for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination. Among his other nominations and awards, he has received two Los Angeles Film Critics Awards, a New York Film Critics Circle Award, a National Board of Review Award, two Independent Spirit Awards, Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup, as well as a Berlinale Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement.Willem was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, to Muriel Isabel (Sprissler), a nurse, and William Alfred Dafoe, a surgeon. He is of mostly German, Irish, Scottish, and English descent. He and his wife, director Giada Colagrande, have made three films together: Padre, A Woman, and Before It Had A Name.His natural adventurousness is evident in roles as diverse as Marcus, the elite assassin who is mentor to Keanu Reeves in the neo-noir John Wick; in his voice work as Gil the Moorish Idol in Finding Nemo and Ryuk the Death God in Death Note; as Paul Smecker, the obsessed FBI agent in the cult classic The Boondock Saints; and as real life hero Leonhard Seppala, who led the 1925 Alaskan dog sled diphtheria serum run in Ericson Core&apos;s Togo. That adventurous spirit continues with upcoming films including Wes Anderson&apos;s The French Dispatch, Abel Ferrara&apos;s Siberia, and Paul Schrader&apos;s The Card Counter.Dafoe is one of the founding members of The Wooster Group, the New York based experimental theatre collective. He created and performed in all of the group&apos;s work from 1977 thru 2005, both in the U.S. and internationally. Since then, he worked with Richard Foreman in Idiot Savant at The Public Theatre (NYC), with Robert Wilson on two international productions: The Life &amp; Death of Marina Abramovic and The Old Woman opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov and developed a new theatre piece, directed by Romeo Castellucci, based on Nathaniel Hawthorne&apos;s The Minister&apos;s Black Veil. He recently completed work on Marina Abramovic&apos;s opera 7 Deaths of Maria Callas.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Matthew Paige Damon was born on October 8, 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Kent Damon, a stockbroker, realtor and tax preparer, and Nancy Carlsson-Paige, an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother, Kyle, a sculptor. His father was of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor Ben Affleck.Damon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, Io e Charlie (1990), and prep-school drama, Scuola d&apos;onore (1992). It was until his film, Geronimo (1993), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, Mystic Pizza (1988). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in Scuola d&apos;onore (1992). Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, Il coraggio della veritÃ  (1996). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems.The following year, he garnered accolades for Will Hunting - Genio ribelle (1997), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. Will Hunting - Genio ribelle (1997) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with Ben Affleck. In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in Steven Spielberg&apos;s film, Salvate il soldato Ryan (1998), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in Il giocatore - Rounders (1998), starring opposite Edward Norton and John Malkovich. The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, Ben Affleck and fellow comedian, Chris Rock, in the comedy Dogma (1999).Towards the end of 1999, Matt played &quot;Tom Ripley&quot;, a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also starred in the movie. Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance. Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, Titan A.E. (2000) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, Passione ribelle (2000) and the golf comedy-drama, La leggenda di Bagger Vance (2000), starring alongside Will Smith. In the year 2003, he signed on to star in The Informant! (2009) by Steven Soderbergh and the Farrelly Brothers&apos; Fratelli per la pelle (2003). He also starred in Gerry (2002), a film he co-wrote with his friends, Gus Van Sant and Casey Affleck. One of Matt&apos;s most recognizable work to date is his role in the &quot;Bourne&quot; movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, in The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum - Il ritorno dello sciacallo (2007). Another praised role is that as &quot;Linus Caldwell&quot; in the &quot;Ocean&apos;s&quot; movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle in Ocean&apos;s Eleven - Fate il vostro gioco (2001). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004) and Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007). Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt has been a part of are Terry Gilliam&apos;s I fratelli Grimm e l&apos;incantevole strega (2005), George Clooney&apos;s Syriana (2005), Martin Scorsese&apos;s The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006) and Robert De Niro&apos;s The Good Shepherd - L&apos;ombra del potere (2006).In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born Luciana Barroso, whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana&apos;s daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella. Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean&apos;s co-stars, George Clooney and Brad Pitt, whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor Ben Affleck, together with Ben&apos;s wife, Jennifer Garner, are also good family friends.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Initially not a science fiction fan, theatre actor Anthony Daniels was persuaded by his agent to meet George Lucas for the casting of C-3PO in Guerre stellari (1977). He went on to perform the character, both his voice and body in the suit, for all the episodic Star Wars films produced. Additionally, he performed the voice of the character for the radio serial based on the original trilogy and the animated series Star Wars: Droids (1985), Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003), Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008), related series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and Star Wars: Rebels (2014).For Star Wars: Episodio I - La minaccia fantasma (1999), he wore a blue Spandex suit, as the android is incomplete in the film and ultimately produced in CGI. In addition to playing the golden droid, he appeared in a live action cameo in the nightclub scene of Star Wars: Episodio II - L&apos;attacco dei cloni (2002) and opera scene in Star Wars: Episodio III - La vendetta dei Sith (2005). As C-3PO, he played a small role in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and The Lego Movie (2014).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tall, leggy, buxom and statuesque 5&apos;7&quot; blonde beauty Sybil Danning reigns supreme as one of the sexiest, most dynamic and commanding actresses to achieve cult B-movie queen status. She was born Sybille Johanna Danninger on May 24, 1952, in Wels, Austria, the daughter of a US Army major father and an Austrian mother. She grew up on army bases in such places as New Jersey, Maryland and Sacramento, California. Sybil attended Etontown&apos;s Star of the Sea Catholic School. At age 14 she worked for her uncle as a dental assistant. Two years later she moved to Vienna, Austria, and worked for a dental supply company. She then relocated to Salzburg and worked as an assistant to a top oral surgeon. Danning then enrolled in the Buchner School of Cosmetology in Salzburg and received a diploma in facial treatment, decorative make-up, manicure and body massage. She soon began doing fashion shows and photo layouts. Danning made her film debut as Lorelei in Dio me l&apos;ha data, guai a chi la tocca (1968). She next portrayed Kriemhild in La piÃ¹ allegra storia del Decamerone (1971). Sybil studied for three years with noted Munich drama coach Anne-Marie Hanschke. Sybil made memorable appearances in such mainstream features as BarbablÃ¹ (1972), I tre moschettieri (1973), Il principe e il povero (1977) and Airport &apos;80 (1979). She also continued to act in such enjoyably lowbrow exploitation items as Le pillole del farmacista (1972), Il caldo letto della vergine (1972) and Cat in the Cage (1978). Danning was especially excellent and impressive as the fierce Valkyrie warrior Saint-Exmin in the science-fiction cult classic I magnifici sette nello spazio (1980). Other notable roles are tough prison inmate Ericka in the babes-behind-bars classic Chained Heat (1983), a formidable female swordfighter in I sette magnifici gladiatori (1983), wicked werewolf queen Stirba in Howling II - L&apos;ululato (1985), a cunning femme fatale English professor in They&apos;re Playing with Fire (1984), the Queen of the Moon in the hilarious Donne amazzoni sulla luna (1987), the strict Warden Sutter in the amusing chicks-in-chains parody Scuola di buone maniere (1986), an alien queen in The Phantom Empire (1988) and a rugged lady bounty hunter in L.A. Bounty (1989). Sybil has done guest spots on the television series Vega$ (1978), Simon &amp; Simon (1981), Visitors (1984), Masquerade (1983), Professione pericolo (1981), I viaggiatori delle tenebre (1983), Il falco della strada (1985) and Superboy (1988). She did a ten-page pictorial for the August 1983 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. Outside of acting, Danning has also worked on several movies as a producer and wrote the story for &quot;L.A. Bounty&quot;. After a regrettably lengthy absence from acting, Sybil Danning has made a welcome comeback by appearing as an evil Nazi villainess in the &quot;Werewolf Women of the SS&quot; mock trailer for Grindhouse (2007) and a nurse in Rob Zombie&apos;s remake Halloween - The Beginning (2007).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in London, England, Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis is the second child of Cecil Day-Lewis (pseudonym Cecil Day-Lewis), Poet Laureate of the U.K., and his second wife, actress Jill Balcon. His maternal grandfather was Sir Michael Balcon, an important figure in the history of British cinema and head of the famous Ealing Studios. His older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis, is a documentarian. His father was of Northern Irish and English descent, and his mother was Jewish (from a family from Latvia and Poland). Daniel was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent, which he despised, and the more progressive Bedales in Petersfield, which he adored. He studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic School. Daniel made his film debut in Domenica maledetta domenica (1971), but then acted on stage with the Bristol Old Vic and Royal Shakespeare Companies and did not appear on screen again until 1982, when he landed his first adult role, a bit part in Gandhi (1982). He also appeared on British television that year in Frost in May (1982) and BBC2 Playhouse: How Many Miles to Babylon? (1982). Notable theatrical performances include Another Country (1982-83), Dracula (1984) and The Futurists (1986).His first major supporting role in a feature film was in Il Bounty (1984), quickly followed by My Beautiful Laundrette - Lavanderia a gettone (1985) and Camera con vista (1985). The latter two films opened in New York on the same day, offering audiences and critics evidence of his remarkable range and establishing him as a major talent. The New York Film Critics named him Best Supporting Actor for those performances. In 1986, he appeared on stage in Richard Eyre&apos;s &quot;The Futurists&quot; and on television in Eyre&apos;s production of Screen Two: The Insurance Man (1986). He also had a small role in a British/French film, Nanou (1986). In 1987, he assumed leading-man status in Philip Kaufman&apos;s L&apos;insostenibile leggerezza dell&apos;essere (1988), followed by a comedic role in the unsuccessful Un gentleman a New York (1988). His brilliant performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan&apos;s Il mio piede sinistro (1989) won him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor.He returned to the stage to work again with Eyre, as Hamlet at the National Theater, but was forced to leave the production close to the end of its run because of exhaustion, and has not appeared on stage since. He took a hiatus from film as well until 1992, when he starred in L&apos;ultimo dei Mohicani (1992), a film that met with mixed reviews but was a great success at the box office. He worked with American director Martin Scorsese in L&apos;etÃ  dell&apos;innocenza (1993), based on Edith Wharton&apos;s novel. Subsequently, he teamed again with Jim Sheridan to star in Nel nome del padre (1993), a critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination. His next project was in the role of John Proctor in father-in-law Arthur Miller&apos;s play La seduzione del male (1996), directed by Nicholas Hytner. He worked with Scorsese again to star in Gangs of New York (2002), another critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.Day-Lewis&apos;s wife, Rebecca Miller, offered him the lead role in her film La storia di Jack e Rose (2005), in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his wife had evolved and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter. During filming, he arranged to live separate from his wife to achieve the &quot;isolation&quot; needed to focus on his own character&apos;s reality. The film received mixed reviews. In 2007, he starred in director Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair&apos;s novel &quot;Oil!&quot;, titled Il petroliere (2007). Day-Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and a variety of film critics&apos; circle awards for the role. In 2009, Day-Lewis starred in Rob Marshall&apos;s musical adaptation Nine (2009) as film director Guido Contini. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Rebecca De Mornay was born 1959 as Rebecca Jane Pearch in Santa Rosa, California. She is the daughter of Julie (Eagar) and Wally George (born George Walter Pearch), a television and radio commentator. Her paternal grandmother was child actress Eugenia Clinchard. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother married Richard De Mornay, who adopted her (Rebecca subsequently took his surname). Rebecca&apos;s paternal grandfather was English, and she also has German, French, and other English, ancestry.After Richard De Mornay&apos;s untimely death, Rebecca&apos;s mother moved her and her half-brother Peter from northern California to Europe, where she was raised primarily in England and Austria. Rebecca graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from a German-speaking high school in the Austrian alps, and still speaks fluent German and French.She began her acting training in Los Angeles at Lee Strasberg&apos;s Institute, became an apprentice at Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Zoetrope Film Studio, and soon thereafter made her film debut in Un sogno lungo un giorno (1981).

He studied physics but at the same time felt his dedication for the movies and made some short films. After seven independent productions he had his first success with Le due sorelle (1972) and his voyeuristic style. Restlessly he worked on big projects with the script writers Paul Schrader, John Farris and Oliver Stone. He also filmed a novel of Stephen King: Carrie - Lo sguardo di Satana (1976). Another important film was The Untouchables - Gli intoccabili (1987) with a script by David Mamet adapted from the TV series.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Danny DeVito has amassed a formidable and versatile body of work as an actor, producer and director that spans the stage, television and film.Daniel Michael DeVito Jr. was born on November 17, 1944, in Neptune, New Jersey, to Italian-American parents. His mother, Julia (Moccello), was a homemaker. His father, Daniel, Sr., was a small business owner whose ventures included a dry cleaning shop, a dairy outlet, a diner, and a pool hall.While growing up in Asbury Park, his parents sent him to private schools. He attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel grammar school and Oratory Prep School. Following graduation in 1962, he took a job as a cosmetician at his sister&apos;s beauty salon. A year later, he enrolled at New York&apos;s American Academy of Dramatic Arts so he could learn more about cosmetology. While at the academy, he fell in love with acting and decided to further pursue an acting career. During this time, he met another aspiring actor Michael Douglas at the National Playwrights Conference in Waterford, Connecticut. The two would later go on to collaborate on numerous projects. Soon after he also met an actress named Rhea Perlman. The two fell in love and moved in together. They were married in 1982 and had three children together.In 1968, Danny landed his first part in a movie when he appeared as a thug in the obscure Dreams of Glass (1970). Despite this minor triumph, Danny became discouraged with the film industry and decided to focus on stage productions. He made his Off-Broadway debut in 1969 in &quot;The Man With the Flower in His Mouth.&quot; He followed this up with stage roles in &quot;The Shrinking Bride,&quot; and &quot;Lady Liberty.&quot; In 1975, he was approached by director Milos Forman and Michael Douglas about appearing in the film version of Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975), which would star Jack Nicholson in the leading role. With box office success almost guaranteed and a chance for national exposure, Danny agreed to the role. The movie became a huge hit, both critically and financially, and still ranks today as one the greatest movies of all time. Unfortunately, the movie did very little to help Danny&apos;s career. In the years following, he was relegated to small movie roles and guest appearances on television shows. His big break came in 1978 when he auditioned for a role on an ABC sitcom pilot called Taxi (1978), which centered around taxi cab drivers at a New York City garage. Danny auditioned for the role of dispatcher Louie DePalma. At the audition, the producers told Danny that he needed to show more attitude in order to get the part. He then slammed down the script and yelled, &quot;Who wrote this sh**?&quot; The producers, realizing he was perfect for the part, brought him on board. The show was a huge success, running from 1978 to 1983.Louie DePalma, played flawlessly by Danny, became one of the most memorable (and reviled) characters in television history. While he was universally hated by TV viewers, he was well-praised by critics, winning an Emmy award and being nominated three other times. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Danny maintained his status as a great character actor with memorable roles in movies like All&apos;inseguimento della pietra verde (1984), Per favore, ammazzatemi mia moglie (1986), Getta la mamma dal treno (1987) and I gemelli (1988). He also had a great deal of success behind the camera, directing movies like La guerra dei Roses (1989) and Hoffa - Santo o mafioso? (1992). In 1992, Danny was introduced to a new generation of moviegoers when he was given the role of The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot in Tim Burton&apos;s highly successful Batman - Il ritorno (1992). This earned him a nomination for Best Villain at the MTV Movie Awards. That same year, along with his then-wife Rhea Perlman, Danny co-founded Jersey Films, which has produced many popular films and TV shows, including Pulp Fiction (1994), Get Shorty (1995), Man on the Moon (1999) and Erin Brockovich - Forte come la veritÃ  (2000). DeVito has many directing credits to his name as well, including Getta la mamma dal treno (1987), La guerra dei Roses (1989), Hoffa - Santo o mafioso? (1992), Eliminate Smoochy (2002) and the upcoming St. Sebastian.In 2006, he returned to series television in the FX comedy series C&apos;Ã¨ sempre il sole a Philadelphia (2005). With a prominent role in a hit series, Devito&apos;s comic talents were now on display for a new generation of television viewers. In 2012, he provided the title voice role in Dr. Seuss&apos; Lorax - Il guardiano della foresta (2012).These days, he continues to work with many of today&apos;s top talents as an actor, director and producer.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sandra Dee was born Alexandria Zuck on April 23, 1942 in Bayonne, New Jersey, to Mary (Cymboliak) and John Zuck. She was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent. Her mother envisioned a show business career for her daughter and would often lie about her age in order to get Sandy where she wanted to go. For example, her mother enrolled her in school early so she could have a head start. Sandy was only four years old when she entered the second grade. Sandra was an extremely pretty young lady, which enabled her to get into modeling. In fact, she was already very successful at her craft by the time she was 12 years old. This in turn led to television commercials for local companies, an added benefit for the young model.Through her mother&apos;s prodding and the talent scouts, Sandra was signed to do a movie when she was 14 called Quattro donne aspettano (1957), released in 1957. While the film didn&apos;t exactly top the charts, it would lay the foundation for Sandra&apos;s career. The new young actress was then signed to two more films for 1958, Come sposare una figlia (1958) and Il frutto del peccato (1958), both with a young actor, John Saxon. In 1959, Sandra appeared in five productions with I cavalloni (1959) and Scandalo al sole (1959) being the two most popular. Sandra was 17 years old and becoming the heartthrob of teenage boys all across America. In 1960, Sandra appeared in only one film, Ritratto in nero (1960), but is remembered by her for something else. She married teen idol Bobby Darin in December of that year. It may have sunk a few teen boys&apos; hearts, but most still were enamored of her. Her work, once again, took off. The 1961 releases were Torna a settembre (1961), Giulietta e Romanoff (1961), and as Tammy Tyree in Dimmi la veritÃ  (1961).Sandra had replaced the ever-popular Debbie Reynolds in the &quot;Tammy&quot; series, but the film and its 1963 sequel, Il sole nella stanza (1963), didn&apos;t do all that well at the box-office. The films were now slowing for Sandra. The last few that she made were Vorrei non essere ricca! (1964), Quello strano sentimento (1965), M 5 codice diamanti (1966), Il mondo Ã¨ pieno... di papÃ  (1967), and Rosie! (1967). By 1967, her marriage to Darin ended and so did her film career. There was little call for a teenage movie star to play daughters and such, when everyone knew that she was a divorcÃ©e. Plus, the face of movies had changed and sugary stories were not the ones that people wanted to see. Sandra did nail down the part of &quot;Nancy Wagner&quot; in 1970&apos;s Le vergini di Dunwich (1970).In the 1970s, Dee made a few appearances in made-for-television movies, but it was the film Grease - Brillantina (1978) that made her famous to a new generation. While she was not in the film, one of the popular songs was &quot;Look At Me, I&apos;m Sandra Dee&quot;.Sandra&apos;s last silver screen role was in Lost (1983). She died of kidney complications on February 20, 2005.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Catherine Fabienne Deneuve was born October 22, 1943 in Paris, France. Her parents were actors. She made her movie debut in 1957, when she was barely a teenager and continued with small parts in minor films, until Roger Vadim gave her a meatier role in Il vizio e la virtu (1963). But her breakthrough came with the excellent musical Les parapluies de Cherbourg (1964), in which she gave an unforgettable performance as a romantic middle-class girl who falls in love with a young soldier but gets imprisoned in a loveless marriage with another man; the director was the gifted Jacques Demy, who also cast Deneuve in the less successful Josephine (1967). She then played a schizophrenic killer in Roman Polanski&apos;s Repulsion (1965) and a married woman who works as a part-time prostitute every afternoon in Luis BuÃ±uel&apos;s masterpiece Bella di giorno (1967). She also worked with BuÃ±uel in Tristana: Una passione morbosa (1970) and gave a great performance for FranÃ§ois Truffaut in La mia droga si chiama Julie (1969), a kind of apotheosis of her &quot;frigid femme fatale&quot; persona. In the seventies she didn&apos;t find parts of that caliber, but her magnificent work in Truffaut&apos;s L&apos;ultimo metrÃ² (1980) as a stage actress in Nazi-occupied Paris revived her career. She was also very good in the recent epic drama Indocina (1992), for which she earned her first Academy Award nomination (Best Actress). Although the elegant and always radiant Deneuve has never appeared on stage, she is universally hailed as one of the &quot;grandes dames&quot; of French cinema, joining a list that includes such illustrious talents as Simone Signoret, Jeanne Moreau, Isabelle Huppert, Isabelle Adjani and the younger Juliette Binoche.</rdfs:comment>

After minor roles in cinema, at last, he got his chance in Bertrand Blier&apos;s I santissimi (1974). That film established a new type of hero in the French cinema and the actor&apos;s popularity grew enormously. Later, he diversified his screen image and became the leading French actor of the 80s and 90s. He was twice awarded a CÃ©sar as Best Actor for L&apos;ultimo metrÃ² (1980) and Cyrano di Bergerac (1990), also received an Oscar nomination for &quot;Cyrano&quot; and a number of awards at international film festivals.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Laura Dern was born on February 10, 1967 in Los Angeles, the daughter of actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd. Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy, and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result.Her parents&apos; background and her own early taste of the moviemaking world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors, her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 60s counterculture parents, she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism, and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Her gawky physical appearance didn&apos;t help - even before her teens, she had achieved most of her impressive 5&apos; 10&quot; height, was rail-skinny (other than precociously wide hips), had huge feet and a slouching posture, and for all this was often teased by classmates. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.The first success for the young Dern came in 1980, with a role in Adrian Lyne&apos;s A donne con gli amici (1980), a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts, or parts in small movies, such as Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Teachers (1984), as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen, which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in &quot;The Fabulous Stains&quot;). Her next roles, as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Dietro la maschera (1985), and as a teenaged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in La prima volta (1985), gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch&apos;s acclaimed Velluto blu (1986), but it was four years before her next notable film, and this was the bizarre Cuore selvaggio (1990), also directed by Lynch.The following year, Dern starred in Rosa Scompiglio e i suoi amanti (1991), which would become her signature performance, as a sexually-precocious, free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance, and so did her mother and co-star, Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen, often in smaller, highly-regarded human dramas such as Cielo d&apos;ottobre (1999), Mi chiamo Sam (2001) and I giochi dei grandi (2004), although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Jurassic Park (1993) and Jurassic Park III (2001), or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994), as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian.Dern&apos;s pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty, but this doesn&apos;t prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering, an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in La storia di Ruth - Donna americana (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today.Having previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams, Renny Harlin, Kyle MacLachlan, Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton, Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career, Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson, the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Matt Dillon&apos;s successful film career has spanned over three decades and has showcased his wide range of dramatic and comedic talents. Dillon displayed his versatility with an arresting performance co-starring as a racist cop in the critically acclaimed Paul Haggis film Crash. This role earned him nominations for an Academy award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics Choice Award, BAFTA Award and won him an Independent Spirit Award. In addition, the film earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Critics Choice Award for Best Ensemble. As the New York Times&apos; Film Critic A.O. Scott put it, &quot;He seems to be getting better with every film.&quot;He starred opposite Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson in Universal Pictures&apos; comedy, You, Me and Dupree and in Factotum for which he received glowing reviews for portraying Charles Bukowski&apos;s alter ego when the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1901-12-05</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Walter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Flora Disney (nÃ©e Call) and Elias Disney, a Canadian-born farmer and businessperson. He had Irish, German, and English ancestry. Walt moved with his parents to Kansas City at age seven, where he spent the majority of his childhood. At age 16, during World War I, he faked his age to join the American Red Cross. He soon returned home, where he won a scholarship to the Kansas City Art Institute. There, he met a fellow animator, Ub Iwerks. The two soon set up their own company. In the early 1920s, they made a series of animated shorts for the Newman theater chain, entitled &quot;Newman&apos;s Laugh-O-Grams&quot;. Their company soon went bankrupt, however.The two then went to Hollywood in 1923. They started work on a new series, about a live-action little girl who journeys to a world of animated characters. Entitled the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot;, they were distributed by M.J. Winkler (Margaret). Walt was backed up financially only by Winkler and his older brother Roy O. Disney, who remained his business partner for the rest of his life. Hundreds of &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; were produced between 1923 and 1927, before they lost popularity.Walt then started work on a series around a new animated character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. This series was successful, but in 1928, Walt discovered that M.J. Winkler and her husband, Charles Mintz, had stolen the rights to the character away from him. They had also stolen all his animators, except for Ub Iwerks. While taking the train home, Walt started doodling on a piece of paper. The result of these doodles was a mouse named Mickey. With only Walt and Ub to animate, and Walt&apos;s wife Lillian Disney (Lilly) and Roy&apos;s wife Edna Disney to ink in the animation cells, three Mickey Mouse cartoons were quickly produced. The first two didn&apos;t sell, so Walt added synchronized sound to the last one, Steamboat Willie (1928), and it was immediately picked up. With Walt as the voice of Mickey, it premiered to great success. Many more cartoons followed. Walt was now in the big time, but he didn&apos;t stop creating new ideas.In 1929, he created the &apos;Silly Symphonies&apos;, a cartoon series that didn&apos;t have a continuous character. They were another success. One of them, Fiori e alberi (1932), was the first cartoon to be produced in color and the first cartoon to win an Oscar; another, I tre porcellini (1933), was so popular it was often billed above the feature films it accompanied. The Silly Symphonies stopped coming out in 1939, but Mickey and friends, (including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, and plenty more), were still going strong and still very popular.In 1934, Walt started work on another new idea: a cartoon that ran the length of a feature film. Everyone in Hollywood was calling it &quot;Disney&apos;s Folly&quot;, but Biancaneve e i sette nani (1937) was anything but, winning critical raves, the adoration of the public, and one big and seven little special Oscars for Walt. Now Walt listed animated features among his ever-growing list of accomplishments. While continuing to produce cartoon shorts, he also started producing more of the animated features. Pinocchio (1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942) were all successes; not even a flop like Fantasia (1940) and a studio animators&apos; strike in 1941 could stop Disney now.In the mid 1940s, he began producing &quot;packaged features&quot;, essentially a group of shorts put together to run feature length, but by 1950 he was back with animated features that stuck to one story, with Cenerentola (1950), Alice nel paese delle meraviglie (1951), and Le avventure di Peter Pan (1953). In 1950, he also started producing live-action films, with L&apos;isola del tesoro (1950). These began taking on greater importance throughout the 50s and 60s, but Walt continued to produce animated features, including Lilli e il vagabondo (1955), La bella addormentata nel bosco (1959), and La carica dei 101 (1961).In 1955 he opened a theme park in southern California: Disneyland. It was a place where children and their parents could take rides, just explore, and meet the familiar animated characters, all in a clean, safe environment. It was another great success. Walt also became one of the first producers of films to venture into television, with his series Disneyland (1954) which he began in 1954 to promote his theme park. He also produced The Mickey Mouse Club (1955) and Zorro (1957). To top it all off, Walt came out with the lavish musical fantasy Mary Poppins (1964), which mixed live-action with animation. It is considered by many to be his magnum opus. Even after that, Walt continued to forge onward, with plans to build a new theme park and an experimental prototype city in Florida.He did not live to see the culmination of those plans, however; in 1966, he developed lung cancer brought on by his lifelong chain-smoking. He died of a heart attack following cancer surgery on December 15, 1966 at age 65. But not even his death, it seemed, could stop him. Roy carried on plans to build the Florida theme park, and it premiered in 1971 under the name Walt Disney World. His company continues to flourish, still producing animated and live-action films and overseeing the still-growing empire started by one man: Walt Disney, who will never be forgotten.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Gaunt character actor Brad Dourif was born Bradford Claude Dourif on March 18, 1950 in Huntington, West Virginia. He is the son of Joan Mavis Felton (Bradford) and Jean Henri Dourif, a French-born art collector who owned and operated a dye factory. His father died when Dourif was three years old, after which his mother married Bill Campbell, a champion golfer, who helped raise Brad, his brother, and his four sisters. From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina, where he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a professional artist, he finally settled on acting as a profession, inspired by his mother&apos;s participation as an actress in community theater.Beginning in school productions, he progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players, while attending Marshall University of Huntington. At age 19, he quit his hometown college and headed to New York City, where he worked with the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including Milos Forman who cast him in Qualcuno volÃ² sul nido del cuculo (1975). Although this film is frequently cited as his film debut, in fact, Dourif made his first big-screen appearance with a bit part in Un uomo da buttare (1975). Nevertheless, his portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Forman&apos;s film was undoubtedly his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut, a British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Skeptical of his instant stardom, Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 when he moved to Hollywood. Despite his attempts to avoid typecasting, his intensity destined him to play eccentric or deranged characters, starting in Occhi di Laura Mars (1978), John Huston&apos;s La saggezza nel sangue (1979) (arguably his best performance to date), and Milos Forman&apos;s Ragtime (1981). Dourif then teamed up with director David Lynch for Dune (1984) and Velluto blu (1986). His high-strung style also served him well in a number of horror films, notably as the voice of the evil doll Chucky in La bambola assassina (1988) and its sequels.Dourif broke from the horror genre with roles in Fatal Beauty (1987), Mississippi Burning - Le radici dell&apos;odio (1988), L&apos;agenda nascosta (1990) and Londra mi fa morire (1991). Recent film work includes the role of Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson&apos;s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since his television debut in the PBS film The Mound Builders (1976), Dourif has made sporadic appearances on a number of television series, such as X-Files (1993), Babylon 5 (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), Millennium (1996) and Ponderosa (2001). He also appeared in the music video &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; (1984) by the rock band TOTO.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Robert Downey Jr. has evolved into one of the most respected actors in Hollywood. With an amazing list of credits to his name, he has managed to stay new and fresh even after over four decades in the business.Downey was born April 4, 1965 in Manhattan, New York, the son of writer, director and filmographer Robert Downey Sr. and actress Elsie Downey (nÃ©e Elsie Ann Ford). Robert&apos;s father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, descent, while Robert&apos;s mother was of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving to California with his father following his parents&apos; 1978 divorce. In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr., himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr. would go on to struggle with abuse for decades.Downey Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Ultima occasione (1985), La donna esplosiva (1985), Verdetto finale (1989), and Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992, Downey received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Actor for his performance in the title role of Charlot - Chaplin (1992).In Robert Altman&apos;s America oggi (1993), he appeared as an aspiring film make-up artist whose best friend commits murder.

Emerging clean and sober in 2003, Downey Jr. began to rebuild his career.He marked his debut into music with his debut album, titled &quot;The Futurist&quot;, on the Sony Classics Label on November 23rd, 2004. The album&apos;s eight original songs, that Downey wrote, and his two musical numbers debuting as cover songs revealed his sultry singing voice and his musical talents. Downey displayed his versatility in two different films in October 2003: the musical/drama The Singing Detective (2003), a remake of the BBC hit of the same name, and the thriller Gothika (2003) starring Halle Berry and PenÃ©lope Cruz.

Her first break was in the unforgettable movie, La febbre del sabato sera (1977) with John Travolta. She continued to play small roles in movies, until she came up with the idea for La tata (1993). She was visiting a friend in England and came up with the plot line. La tata (1993) became an instant success, and so did Fran. Since then, she has been in films such as L&apos;amore Ã¨ un trucco (1997) (which she also produced) and Ho solo fatto a pezzi mia moglie (2000) co-starring Woody Allen.

His paternal grandparents were Austro-Hungarian Jewish immigrants, and his mother&apos;s family was Russian Jewish.Richard worked his way up through bit parts (Il laureato (1967), for one) and TV before gaining attention with his portrayal of Baby Face Nelson in John Milius&apos; Dillinger (1973). He gained prominence as a college-bound young man in American Graffiti (1973) and as a nervy Jewish kid with high hopes in Soldi ad ogni costo (1974). By the latter part of the 1970s Dreyfuss was established as a major star, playing leads (and alter-egos) for Steven Spielberg in two of the top-grossing films of the that decade: Lo squalo (1975) and Incontri ravvicinati del terzo tipo (1977). He won a Best Actor Oscar in his first romantic lead as an out-of-work actor in Goodbye amore mio! (1977). Dreyfuss also produced and starred in the entertaining private eye movie Moses Wine detective (1978). After a brief lull in the early 1980s, a well-publicized drug problem and a string of box-office disappointments (Competition (1980), Di chi Ã¨ la mia vita? (1981), Cercasi papÃ  (1984)), a clean and sober Dreyfuss re-established himself in the mid-&apos;80s as one of Hollywood&apos;s more engaging leads. He co-starred with Bette Midler and Nick Nolte in Paul Mazursky&apos;s popular Su e giÃ¹ per Beverly Hills (1986). That same year he provided the narration and appeared in the opening and closing &quot;bookends&quot; of Rob Reiner&apos;s nostalgic Stand by Me - Ricordo di un&apos;estate (1986). He quickly followed that with Pazza (1987) opposite Barbra Streisand, Barry Levinson&apos;s Tin Men - 2 imbroglioni con signora (1987) in a memorable teaming with Danny DeVito, and Sorveglianza... speciale (1987) with Emilio Estevez. Dreyfuss continued working steadily through the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, most notably in Mazursky&apos;s farce Il dittatore del Parador in arte Jack (1988), Spielberg&apos;s Always - Per sempre (1989), Cartoline dall&apos;inferno (1990) and Rosencrantz e Guildenstern sono morti (1990). He appeared as a member of an ensemble that included Holly Hunter, Gena Rowlands and Danny Aiello in the romantic comedy Ancora una volta (1991) and as a pop psychiatrist, the author of several successful self-help books, who is driven to the edge by nutcase Bill Murray in the popular comedy Tutte le manie di Bob (1991). Dreyfuss has also remained active in the theater (&quot;Death and Maiden&quot;, 1992) and on TV. In his next project he starred the thriller Rosso d&apos;autunno (1994) with John Lithgow and Linda Hamilton, being the film debut of Liv Tyler, Steven Tyler&apos;s daughter (Aerosmith&apos;s lead vocals). Just later Dreyfuss made Occhio al testimone (1993), sequel of Sorveglianza... speciale (1987) where was team again with Emilio Estevez accompanied of Rosie O&apos;Donnell, the adaptation of Neil Simon&apos;s play Proibito amare (1993) and followed with a supporting turn as the querulous political opponent in Il presidente - Una storia d&apos;amore (1995). Dreyfuss received some of the best notices of his career as a determined, inspiring music teacher coping with a deaf son and the demands of his career in Goodbye Mr. Holland (1995). Closing the 20th century he was in Sidney Lumet&apos;s Prove apparenti (1996) with Andy Garcia, the crime comedy Il tempo dei cani pazzi (1996) as the mob boss Vic, the screwball comedy Cercasi tribÃ¹ disperatamente (1998) about an anthropologist who creates a false lost New Guinea tribe for not losing his job in the university, TV movie Lansky - Un cervello al servizio della mafia (1999) about the infamous mob boss to end, the too TV movie A prova di errore (2000) playing The President, and I soliti amici (2000), about four older mobsters retired in Miami, partnering with Hollywood legends Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassel.His start in the 21st century was with the adaption of Luis SepÃºlveda&apos;s novel Il vecchio che leggeva romanzi d&apos;amore (2001), playing an old man to must to hunt a female jaguar turned crazy. It was followed by the supporting apparition in the comedy Chi Ã¨ Cletis Tout? (2001) and another TV movie about 1981 Ronald Reagan&apos;s shooting Il giorno dell&apos;attentato a Reagan (2001). After the short-lived TV series The Education of Max Bickford (2001) about a teacher in a women&apos;s college where his daughter is student, Dreyfuss returned to cinema in Silver City (2004) and the box-office bomb Poseidon (2006) with Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum and Josh Lucas. Playing former vice-president Dick Cheney in the Oliver Stone&apos;s biopic W. (2008) and Irv, the cunning tourist in Greece turned in assistant of a troubled tour guide in Le mie grosse grasse vacanze greche (2009), Dreyfuss participated in low-budget productions as Fratelli in erba (2009) and I guardiani del faro (2009), for making a cameo in the wild and crazy Piranha 3D (2010) about prehistoric men-eater piranhas that make a bloodbath in a spring break. Returning to first line playing evil Alexander Dunning in the actioner RED (2010), his further productions included Il potere dei soldi (2013) as Liam Hemsworth&apos;s father partnering Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, road movie Cas &amp; Dylan (2013) opposites Tatiana Maslany and the biopic TV mini-series Madoff (2016) about the infamous multi-billion-dollar and hustler Bernie Madoff. Tireless and always implied in new projects, Dreyfuss played George, the funny online date of Candice Bergen in Book Club - Tutto puÃ² succedere (2018), the comedy and road movie Un&apos;ultima risata (2019) with Chevy Chase, and the set in wilderness thriller Daughter of the Wolf - La figlia del lupo (2019) with Gina Carano and Brendan Fehr. Making his 73rd birthday in 2020, Dreyfuss is an example of talent, diversity and love for his work, touching not only all the genres in cinema but leaving an unforgettable footprint at any of them.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1931-01-05</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Veteran actor and director Robert Selden Duvall was born on January 5, 1931, in San Diego, CA, to Mildred Virginia (Hart), an amateur actress, and William Howard Duvall, a career military officer who later became an admiral. Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I. Bill in 1955, studying under Sanford Meisner along with Dustin Hoffman, with whom Duvall shared an apartment. Both were close to another struggling young actor named Gene Hackman. Meisner cast Duvall in the play &quot;The Midnight Caller&quot; by Horton Foote, a link that would prove critical to his career, as it was Foote who recommended Duvall to play the mentally disabled &quot;Boo Radley&quot; in Il buio oltre la siepe (1962). This was his first &quot;major&quot; role since his 1956 motion picture debut as an MP in LassÃ¹ qualcuno mi ama (1956), starring Paul Newman.Duvall began making a name for himself as a stage actor in New York, winning an Obie Award in 1965 playing incest-minded longshoreman &quot;Eddie Carbone&quot; in the off-Broadway revival of Arthur Miller&apos;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, a production for which his old roommate Hoffman was assistant director. He found steady work in episodic TV and appeared as a modestly billed character actor in films, such as Arthur Penn&apos;s La caccia (1966) with Marlon Brando and in Robert Altman&apos;s Conto alla rovescia (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Non torno a casa stasera (1969), in both of which he co-starred with James Caan.He was also memorable as the heavy who is shot by John Wayne at the climax of Il Grinta (1969) and was the first &quot;Maj. Frank Burns&quot;, creating the character in Altman&apos;s Korean War comedy M.A.S.H. (1970). He also appeared as the eponymous lead in George Lucas&apos; directorial debut, L&apos;uomo che fuggÃ¬ dal futuro (1971). It was Francis Ford Coppola, casting Il padrino (1972), who reunited Duvall with Brando and Caan and provided him with his career breakthrough as mob lawyer &quot;Tom Hagen&quot;. He received the first of his six Academy Award nominations for the role.Thereafter, Duvall had steady work in featured roles in such films as Il padrino - Parte II (1974), Killer Elite (1975), Quinto potere (1976), Sherlock Holmes: soluzione settepercento (1976) and La notte dell&apos;aquila (1976). Occasionally this actor&apos;s actor got the chance to assay a lead role, most notably in Tomorrow (1972), in which he was brilliant as William Faulkner&apos;s inarticulate backwoods farmer. He was less impressive as the lead in Agente 373 Police Connection (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective Eddie Egan, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as &quot;Popeye Doyle&quot; in Il braccio violento della legge (1971).It was his appearance as &quot;Lt. Col. Kilgore&quot; in another Coppola picture, Apocalypse Now (1979), that solidified Duvall&apos;s reputation as a great actor. He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning!&quot;Subsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in Il grande Santini (1979) and Un tenero ringraziamento (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled &quot;Oscar curse&quot; that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners Luise Rainer, Rod Steiger and Cliff Robertson. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in Il padrino - Parte III (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of Al Pacino, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone.His greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series Colomba solitaria (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He received a second Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Stalin (1992), and a third Emmy nomination playing Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in The Man Who Captured Eichmann (1996).The shakeout of his career doldrums was that Duvall eventually settled back into his status as one of the premier character actors in the industry, rivaled only by his old friend Gene Hackman. Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary We&apos;re Not the Jet Set (1977), Angelo My Love (1983) and Assassination Tango (2002). As a writer-director, Duvall gave himself one of his most memorable roles, that of the preacher on the run from the law in L&apos;apostolo (1997), a brilliant performance for which he received his third Best Actor nomination and fifth Oscar nomination overall. The film brought Duvall back to the front ranks of great actors, and was followed by a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod for A Civil Action (1998).Robert Duvall will long be remembered as one of the great naturalistic American screen actors in the mode of Spencer Tracy and his frequent co-star Marlon Brando. His performances as &quot;Boo Radley&quot; in Il buio oltre la siepe (1962), &quot;Jackson Fentry&quot; in Tomorrow (1972), &quot;Tom Hagen&quot; in the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; movies, &quot;Frank Hackett&quot; in Quinto potere (1976), &quot;Lt. Col. Kilgore&quot; in Apocalypse Now (1979), &quot;Bull Meechum&quot; in Il grande Santini (1979), &quot;Mac Sledge&quot; in Un tenero ringraziamento (1983), &quot;Gus McCrae&quot; in Colomba solitaria (1989) and &quot;Sonny Dewey&quot; in L&apos;apostolo (1997) rank as some of the finest acting ever put on film. It&apos;s a body of work that few actors can equal, let alone surpass.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1962-07-19</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Anthony Edwards was born in Santa Barbara, California, on July 19, 1962, to a well-blended family. He is the youngest of five children, and the son of Erika Kem (Weber), a landscape painter and artist, and Peter Edwards, an architect. His mother was of German descent, and his father was of English, Irish, Scottish, and Spanish-Mexican ancestry.Edwards&apos;s parents encouraged him to act at age 16, which eventually led him to attending a summer workshop in London before graduating from high school. Returning to the United States, Edwards worked in commercials, jobs that helped him pay his education at The University of Southern California, where he studied acting. However, he dropped out of college and, in that same year, he had a small role in the movie Fuori di testa (1982), starring Sean Penn. The movie was a box office smash and Edwards was looking forward to doing more films. His first movie role was that of teen-aged &quot;John Muldowney&quot; in Dragster: vivere a 300 all&apos;ora (1983) and his first starring role as nerdy &quot;Gilbert Lowell&quot;, in La rivincita dei nerds (1984).Edwards didn&apos;t need to worry about being typecast as a socially-challenged loser. After starring in Sacco a pelo a tre piazze (1985) and Toccato! (1985), he landed another big-time successful movie Top Gun (1986), in which he played Tom Cruise&apos;s ill-fated easy-going navigator/best friend, Lt. Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw. As Cruise rode Top Gun (1986) into the Hollywood stratosphere, Edwards also found his flight to stardom, at the same time. After Top Gun (1986), he reprised his role as Gilbert in the movie La rivincita dei nerds II (1987), before he starred in Brivido d&apos;estate (1987). He also starred in Mr. North (1988), and Soluzione finale (1988), although they weren&apos;t too successful.Edwards began working in TV movies and continued to star in more box office movies such as Hawks (1988), Commissione d&apos;esame (1989), Pronti a tutto (1990), Cimitero vivente 2 (1992), Omicidi dal passato (1992) and I delitti di New Orleans (1992). The &apos;90s won Edwards his best reviews for his recurring role of the quirky &quot;bubble man&quot; Mike Monroe on the popular television series Un medico fra gli orsi (1990). He was nominated for a Cable Ace Award in HBO&apos;s Sexual Healing (1993), and the following year, he starred in Il fantasma di Charlie (1995), before he played law clerk &quot;Clint Von Hooser&quot; in the John Grisham movie Il cliente (1994). This led to his most prominent role, as easy-going charismatic physician &quot;Dr. Mark Greene&quot; on the very popular TV series E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994).For his work on E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), he was nominated for an Emmy Award four times For Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, but has never won. However, he has won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-in-a-TV-Series, and was nominated four times, and also has two Screen Actor&apos;s Guild Awards. Prior to playing Dr. Greene, he also played bank breaker turned cold-blooded killer, &quot;Dick Hickock&quot; in the TV movie remake of Truman Capote&apos;s A sangue freddo (1996), which was the best TV movie of the 1996-97 season. During Edwards&apos; hiatus on E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), he went back to the box office circuit to star and to produce the movie Non per sport... ma per amore (1999), a complex movie which wasn&apos;t a big hit. Edwards, once again, returned to the set of E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), and this time, he signed up for a salary that almost no actor could be paid, so his decision was to stay on the show for 3 more years and possibly to save the money in order to spend a lot of family time and to work on directing later.His first big roles after E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994) were that of &quot;Brains&quot; in the movie Thunderbirds (2004), and as &quot;Jim Paretta&quot; in The Forgotten (2004). In the many years that he starred on E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), that show gave him more success in working on and off the set. Also, it gave him a spiritual blessing that so many popular actors have had over the years.</rdfs:comment>

Won attention at the Sundance Film Festival for earlier work, then broke through critically and commercially with Exotica (1994). Afterwards, Il dolce domani (1997) led him to receive two Academy Award nominations, and then Chloe - Tra seduzione e inganno (2009) became his biggest moneymaker ever (after the film&apos;s DVD/Blu-ray release).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As Danny Elfman was growing up in the Los Angeles area, he was largely unaware of his talent for composing. It wasn&apos;t until the early 1970s that Danny and his older brother Richard Elfman started a musical troupe while in Paris; the group &quot;Mystic Knights of Oingo-Boingo&quot; was created for Richard&apos;s directorial debut, Forbidden Zone (1980) (now considered a cult classic by Elfman fans). The group&apos;s name went through many incarnations over the years, beginning with &quot;The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo&quot; and eventually just Oingo Boingo. While continuing to compose eclectic, intelligent rock music for his L.A.-based band (some of which had been used in various film soundtracks, e.g. La donna esplosiva (1985)), Danny formed a friendship with young director Tim Burton, who was then a fan of Oingo Boingo. Danny went on to score the soundtrack of Pee-wee&apos;s Big Adventure (1985), Danny&apos;s first orchestral film score. The Elfman-Burton partnership continued (most notably through the hugely-successful &quot;Batman&quot; flicks) and opened doors of opportunity for Danny, who has been referred to as &quot;Hollywood&apos;s hottest film composer&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

Elliott began his acting career on the stage and his film debut was in Butch Cassidy (1969). Although his future wife, Katharine Ross co-starred in the film, the two did not meet until they filmed Il testamento (1978) Together. Over the years there would be few opportunities to act in feature westerns, but it would be television that gave him that opportunity, in The Sacketts (1979), Ombre a cavallo (1982) and Yellow Rose (1983), among others. He would also work in non-westerns, usually as a tough guy, as in Il bagnino (1976) and Il duro del Road House (1989). In the 1990s, Elliott was back on the western trail, playing everyone from Brig. Gen. John Buford in the film Gettysburg (1993) to Wild Bill Hickok in the made-for-TV movie Buffalo Girls (1995). In 1991 he wrote the screenplay and co-starred with his wife in the made-for-TV western Conagher (1991).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Roland Emmerich is a German film director and producer of blockbuster films like The Day After Tomorrow - L&apos;alba del giorno dopo (2004), Godzilla (1998), Independence Day (1996) and Il patriota (2000). Before fame, he originally wanted to be a production designer, but decided to be a director, after watching the original Guerre stellari (1977). Emmerich began his career in his native Germany. In his youth, he pursued painting and sculpting. While enrolled in the director&apos;s program at film school in Munich, his student film 1997: il principio dell&apos;arca di NoÃ¨ (1984) went on to open the 1984 Berlin Film Festival. The feature became a huge success and was sold to more than 20 countries. In an amazing trivia, he directed his first feature, 1997: il principio dell&apos;arca di NoÃ¨ (1984), in 1984. He is openly gay and a campaigner for the LGBT community.A director/writer/producer with a flair for special effects-driven action, German Roland Emmerich made himself at home in blockbuster-hungry 1990s Hollywood. Born and educated in West Germany, Emmerich studied production design as well as direction at the Munich Film and Television School. After his student film, The Noah&apos;s Ark Principle, debuted at the 1984 Berlin Film Festival, Emmerich formed his production company Centropolis and directed supernatural fantasies Making Contact (1986) and Ghost Chase (1987), and the straight-to-video action film Moon 44 (1990). On the latter, he met actor Dean Devlin who subsequently switched jobs to become Emmerich&apos;s writing and producing partner once Emmerich set up shop in Hollywood.After making his solo Hollywood debut directing Jean-Claude Van Damme in the cyborg action fest Universal Soldier (1992), Emmerich and Devlin revealed a talent for conjuring A-level action spectacles out of B-movie scenarios with their first film together, Stargate (1994). A space odyssey mixing ancient Egyptiana and high-tech wizardry, Stargate became an unexpected hit. Emmerich hit his blockbuster stride with his next film, Independence Day (1996). With its eye-popping destruction of major cities and climactic annihilation of a spacecraft via portable computer, Independence Day blew away its summer movie competition on the strength of its visual flash. Geared to repeat with the endlessly- and creatively-hyped version of Godzilla (1998), Emmerich instead faced the conundrum of directing a $100 million grossing film that did not live up to box office expectations. Emmerich and Devlin next turned their epic visions to the decidedly lower-tech (but still CGI-enhanced) action of the American Revolution in the Mel Gibson summer vehicle The Patriot (2000).</rdfs:comment>

He rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant, and later was bestowed the honorary rank of Gunnery Sergeant by the Marine Corps, after he served 14 months in Vietnam and later did two tours in Okinawa, Japan.

He appeared in several Filipino films before being cast as a helicopter pilot in Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Apocalypse Now (1979). Due to his Vietnam experiences, Coppola also utilized him as a technical adviser. He got a featured role in Sidney J. Furie&apos;s I ragazzi della Compagnia C (1978), playing a drill instructor. Ermey worked with Furie again in Dimensione inferno (1984).However, his most famous (or infamous) role came as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Stanley Kubrick&apos;s Full Metal Jacket (1987), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. He did win the best supporting actor award from The Boston Society of Film Critics. Since then, he has appeared in numerous character roles in such films as Via da Las Vegas (1995), Seven (1995) and Dead Man Walking - Condannato a morte (1995).

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emilio Estevez was born on May 12, 1962, in New York City. He is the eldest son of actor Martin Sheen, who at the time was just breaking into the business. His mother, Janet Sheen (nÃ©e Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Emilio&apos;s father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Charlie Sheen, RenÃ©e Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.He lived on Manhattan&apos;s Upper West Side until his family relocated to Malibu in 1968. Before graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, Estevez had already had a small role as a messenger boy in Apocalypse Now (1979), that was ultimately cut from the film.Though his father had opted to use the stage name &quot;Sheen&quot; over his more ethnic birth name &quot;Estevez,&quot; Emilio chose to retain the family name, hoping to avoid riding his father&apos;s coattails. He also thought the double &quot;E&quot; set of initials was &quot;pretty.&quot;He appeared in a few TV movies, the first of which was Insight: 17 Going on Nowhere (1980), before making his big-screen debut opposite Matt Dillon in 1982&apos;s Un ragazzo chiamato Tex (1982). A part in I ragazzi della 56Âª strada (1983) followed, and Estevez made his first big splash as the punk rocker Otto in the cult classic Repo Man - Il recuperatore (1984).Originally cast as Bender (The Criminal) in the seminal John Hughes flick Breakfast Club (1985), Estevez took the part of Andrew (The Athlete) instead after Hughes could find no one else to fill the role. Another ensemble film, St. Elmo&apos;s Fire (1985) came next. Then Estevez made his screen-writing debut with Due vite in una (1985), a film in which he also starred.He then starred in the Stephen King thriller Brivido (1986), but the film was a failure. The ambitious young actor added directing to his palette with Wisdom (1986) in 1986, but the film was universally panned and struck out at the box office. Estevez quickly rebounded with hits like Sorveglianza... speciale (1987) and Young Guns - Giovani pistole (1988), as well as their subsequent sequels. He tried his hand at directing again with Il giallo del bidone giallo (1990) before taking on one of his most famous roles as Coach Gordon Bombay in Stoffa da campioni (1992). The enormously popular Disney film spawned sequels and an NHL hockey team of the same name, but Estevez was interested in making weighter films.He agreed to make a brief appearance in Ducks - Una squadra a tutto ghiaccio (1996) in exchange for Disney helping him finance and distribute another effort as actor-director, Conflitti di famiglia (1996). Though smiled on by critics, Conflitti di famiglia (1996) received a paltry distribution by Disney and thus went largely unseen. A devastated Estevez considered quitting the business but has ultimately continued to work in films, including a fourth effort as director and star, Rated X - La vera storia dei re del porno americano (2000), which co-starred brother Charlie Sheen and was a selection at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2006, Bobby (2006), a film about the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy that Estevez wrote, directed, and acted in, premiered at the Venice Film Festival and received a seven-minute standing ovation.</rdfs:comment>

He is of mostly English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.Everett grew up in privileged circumstances, but the wry, sometimes arrogant, intellectual was a rebel from the very beginning. At the age of seven, he was placed into the care of Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College where he trained classically on the piano. He was expelled from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London for clashing with his teachers and instead apprenticed himself at the avant-garde Glasgow Citizen&apos;s Theatre in Scotland, performing in such productions as &apos;Don Juan&apos; and &apos;Heartbreak House&apos;.In 1984 Everett successfully filmed a lead role in Another Country - La scelta (1984), which he had performed earlier on stage and shot to international attention, becoming one of England&apos;s hottest new star. But again the wickedly sharp and suave rebel doused his own fire by clashing with the press and even with his own fans. In 1989, Everett openly declared his own homosexuality. His career revitalized as Julia Roberts&apos; gay confidante in Il matrimonio del mio migliore amico (1997), and he has continued to impress notably in the classics area with Shakespeare in Love (1998) (as Christopher Marlowe), Un marito ideale (1999) and Sogno di una notte di mezza estate (1999) (as Oberon). Lately he has enhanced both films with his royal portrayals in Uccidere il re (2003) and Stage Beauty (2004), and television with his effortlessly suave Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock Holmes ed il caso della calza di seta (2004). His predilection for smug and smarmy villains of late such as the cartoonish Dr. Claw in Inspector Gadget (1999) has extended into voice animation with his &quot;unprincely&quot; Prince Charming character in Shrek 2 (2004).</rdfs:comment>

On choosing to change careers, he studied the acting art with Eva Le Gallienne and Sanford Meisner. His most famous role is that of the detective Colombo (1971); however, this was not his first foray into acting the role of a detective. During a high school play, he stood in for such a role when the original student actor fell sick.

Among his siblings are actors Kevin P. Farley and John Farley. He was of Irish heritage. Farley studied theatre and communications on Marquette University. After finishing University Chris was in the cast of the Second City Theatre, where he was discovered by the producer of the great comedy-show Il Saturday Night Live (1975), Lorne Michaels. Chris worked on Il Saturday Night Live (1975) for five years during which he appeared in movies like Fusi di testa (1992), Teste di cono (1993), Billy Madison (1995) and finally Tommy Boy (1995), with his comic partner and SNL cast member David Spade. The duo later made one more movie called La pecora nera (1996). From that time on, Chris was one of the big comedy stars, and his fame was growing and growing.After some more time, he made another &quot;lone&quot; movie, Mai dire ninja (1997), which featured former SNL member Chris Rock. Farley was made even more famous, but with his growing fame, his problems grew bigger as well; he didn&apos;t want to be the &quot;fat guy who falls down&quot; any longer. Chris had several other problems, too, with alcohol and drug dependency. On December 18th, 1997, he died from a heroin (opiate) and cocaine overdose in his apartment in Chicago, where his body was found by his brother John the next day. Chris&apos; weight of 296 pounds was a contributing factor to his death, but according to his autopsy the alcohol, marijuana and Prozac that was also found in his body, were not. Less than two months prior to Farley&apos;s death, he had appeared alongside Chevy Chase on what would be Farley&apos;s only SNL show as host. Not unlike his idol John Belushi, he was credited for one more appearance after having left SNL and died at age 33. His death cause was also the same. In the year after Chris&apos; departing, the movie Almost Heroes (1998), where he plays the leading role alongside Matthew Perry was released. He also makes cameo appearances in Dirty Work - Agenzia lavori sporchi (1998)</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Terry Farrell was born on November 19, 1963 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At age 15, she became a foreign exchange student to Mexico, and, from that experience, she decided she would like to live a more adventurous life in the big city. She sent several photos to a modeling agency and then, at age 17, dropped out of high school and became a model in New York. She is most famously known for her role as Jadzia Dax in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), but she did have some acting experience before that. In 1992, she had the starring role in the horror movie Hellraiser III - Inferno sulla cittÃ  (1992). She appeared in several television and straight-to-video movies, and also dated actors Michael Dorn and Mickey Rourke while on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993). Afterward, Paramount decided to move her to the sitcom Becker (1998), where she played the character Reggie Kostas, but, after four seasons, she was replaced by Nancy Travis. Since then, she has not been in many mainstream events. In September 2002, she married Brian Baker, better known as the cell-phone company Sprint&apos;s spokesperson.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1947-02-02</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Farrah Fawcett is a true Hollywood success story. Born in Texas, she was the daughter of Pauline Fawcett (Pauline Alice Evans), a homemaker, and James Fawcett, an oil field contractor. She was a natural athlete, something that her father encouraged, and she attended a high school with a strong arts program. She attended the University of Texas in Austin, graduating with a degree in Microbiology, but only wanted to be an actress.Winning a campus beauty contest got her noticed by an agent, who encouraged her to pursue acting. After graduating, she moved to Los Angeles and her healthy, all-American blond beauty was immediately noticed. She quickly got roles in various television commercials for such products as Ultra-Brite toothpaste, and Wella Balsam shampoo, and also made appearances in some TV series. In 1968, she met another Southerner, actor Lee Majors, star of the popular TV series La grande vallata (1965), on a blind date set up by their publicists. He became very taken with her and also used his own standing to promote her career. In 1969, she made her film debut in Un tipo che mi piace (1969). The next year, she appeared in the film adaptation of the Gore Vidal bestselling novel Il caso Myra Breckinridge (1970). The shooting was very unpleasant, with much feuding on the set, and Farrah was embarrassed by the finished film, which was a major failure. But Farrah was undamaged and continued to win roles. In 1973, she and Majors married, and the following year, she won a recurring role in the crime series, Harry O (1973). She had her first taste of major success when she won a supporting role in the science fiction film, La fuga di Logan (1976). She came to the attention of the highly successful producer Aaron Spelling, who was impressed by her beauty and vivacious personality. That won her a role in the TV series, Charlie&apos;s Angels (1976). She played a private investigator who works for a wealthy and mysterious businessman, along with two other glamorous female detectives, played by Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith. The show immediately became the most popular series on television, earning record ratings and a huge audience. All three actresses became very popular, but Farrah became, by far, the best known. She won the People&apos;s Choice Award for Favorite Female Performer in a New TV program in 1977. Her lush, free-wheeling, wavy blond hair also became a phenomenon, with millions of women begging their hairstylists to give them &quot;The Farrah&quot;, as her hairstyle was called. Fawcett was also a savvy businesswoman, and she received 10% profit from the proceeds of her famous poster in a red swimsuit. It sold millions and she became the &quot;It Girl&quot; of the 1970s.Fawcett was America&apos;s sweetheart and found herself on every celebrity magazine and pursued by photographers and fans. While she enjoyed the success and got along well with her co-stars (both of whom were also of Southern origin), she found the material lightweight. Also, the long hours she worked were beginning to take a toll on her marriage to Majors, who found himself eclipsed by her popularity. So the following year, when the show was at its peak, she left to pursue a movie career. Charlie&apos;s Angels&apos; producers sued her, and the studios shied away from her, and she lost out on the lead role in the hit feature film Gioco sleale (1978) to Goldie Hawn. Eventually, she and the Charlie&apos;s Angels producers reached a settlement, where she would make guest appearances on the series. As a result of the negative publicity and some poor script choices, her career briefly hit a slow spot. In addition, she and Majors separated in 1979. She had starring roles in Chi ha ucciso suo marito? (1978), Sunburn, bruciata dal sole (1979), and Saturn 3 (1980) (which she did a topless scene in), but all three failed financially. She appeared in the Burt Reynolds chase comedy La corsa piÃ¹ pazza d&apos;America (1981), which was successful financially, but it was met not only with bad reviews but also with bad publicity when Farrah&apos;s stunt double Heidi Von Beltz was involved in a stunt that went horribly wrong and left her a quadriplegic. Farrah&apos;s feature film career came to a halt, and she and Majors were drifting apart. In 1981, she met Ryan O&apos;Neal, a friend of her husband&apos;s, and they began became friends and spent a great deal of time together. He also encouraged her to go back to television and she received good reviews in the well-received miniseries, Assassinio nel Texas (1981). In 1982, she filed for divorce, which Majors readily agreed to. Soon, she and O&apos;Neal were a couple and moved in together. She set on sights on becoming a serious dramatic actress. She took over for Susan Sarandon in the stage play, &quot;Extremities&quot;, where she played a rape victim who turns the tables on her rapist. That, in turn, led her to her major comeback, when she starred in the searing story of a battered wife in Autopsia di un delitto (1984), based on a true story. It garnered a very large audience, and critics gave her the best reviews she had ever received for her heartfelt performance. She was nominated for both an Emmy and Golden Globe and also became involved in helping organizations for battered women. The following year, she and O&apos;Neal became the parents of a son, Redmond O&apos;Neal. She tried to continue her momentum with a starring role in the feature film adaptation of Oltre ogni limite (1986), and while she garnered a Golden Globe nomination, the film, itself, was not a hit.She continued to seek out serious roles, appearing mainly on television. She scored success again in Sacrificio d&apos;amore (1989), again based on a true crime. Portraying an unhappy woman who is so obsessed with the man she loves that she shoots her children to make herself available and disguises it as a carjacking, Farrah again won rave reviews and helped draw a large audience, and was nominated for an Emmy again. Shortly afterwards, she and O&apos;Neal co-starred in Good Sports (1991), playing a couple who co-star in a sports news program, but O&apos;Neal&apos;s performance was lambasted and only 9 episodes were aired. In 1995, she surprised her fans by posing for &quot;Playboy&quot; at the age of 48, it became the magazine&apos;s best-selling issue of that decade.Her relationship with O&apos;Neal was deteriorating, however, and in 1997, they broke up. The breakup took a toll, and she posed for Playboy again at the age of 50. To promote it, she appeared on Late Show with David Letterman (1993) and gave a rambling interview, sparking rumors of drug use. That same year, however, she made another comeback in L&apos;apostolo (1997), playing the neglected wife of a Pentacostal preacher, played by Robert Duvall. Both stars were praised and the film became a surprise hit. She also began dating James Orr, who had directed her earlier in the feature film, L&apos;uomo di casa (1995). An incident occurred between them in 1998, and Farrah suffered injuries. The scandal drew nationwide headlines, especially after the tabloids published photos of Farrah with her injuries. The authorities compelled Fawcett to testify against Orr in court, and he was found guilty of assault and given a minimum sentence. Embarrassed, she lowered her profile and her career lost momentum, but she continued to work in television and films. She and O&apos;Neal also started seeing each other again, when he was diagnosed with leukemia. The new millennium brought her highs and lows. In 2000, she acted with Richard Gere in Robert Altman&apos;s film, Il dottor T &amp; le donne (2000). Her son Redmond has had problems with drug abuse and has been in and out of jail. In 2001, she lost her only sister, Diane Fawcett Walls, to cancer. In 2004, she received her third Emmy nomination for her performance in The Guardian (2003), and she starred in her own reality show, titled Chasing Farrah (2005), in 2005 along with Ryan O&apos;Neal, but that ended after only 7 episodes. That same year, she was devastated when her beloved mother, Pauline Fawcett, died. In 2006, producer Aaron Spelling died, and she famously reunited with her Charlie&apos;s Angels co-stars, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, at the Emmys, in a tribute to him. She looked tan and healthy, but soon, she was diagnosed with anal cancer. She asked her friend Alana Stewart to accompany her and videotape her during her doctor&apos;s visits. Those video journals resulted in the documentary Farrah&apos;s Story (2009), co-executive produced by Fawcett. It aired in 2009, and viewers were shocked to see Farrah with a shaved head and in a continuous state of pain. Ryan O&apos;Neal and Alana Stewart were constantly by her side, and her Charlie&apos;s Angels co-stars, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, also visited her, marking the final time that all three original Angels appeared together on television. The documentary became a ratings success, and it earned a Emmy nomination as Outstanding Nonfiction Special. On June 25, 2009 Farrah lost her battle with cancer and passed away at aged 62. She left the bulk of her estate to her only son Redmond, and her trust fund allowed for the creation of The Farrah Fawcett Foundation, which provides funding for cancer research and prevention. Alana Stewart is the president of the Foundation and Jaclyn Smith&apos;s husband Dr. Brad Allen is one of the Board of Directors. Ryan O&apos;Neal and Farrah&apos;s nephew, Greg Walls, are also on the Advisory Board, keeping alive her legacy.</rdfs:comment>

He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting. In 1973, at the age of 12, Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap Una vita da vivere (1968) that lasted three seasons and subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). At 14 Francis Ford Coppola cast him in Apocalypse Now (1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn&apos;t work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in Rusty il selvaggio (1983), Cotton Club (1984), and Giardini di pietra (1987).Throughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show Pee-wee&apos;s Playhouse (1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. With the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in John Singleton&apos;s urban tale Boyz n the Hood - Strade violente (1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA&apos;s turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film. On stage, he would become invariably linked to playwright August Wilson and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in &quot;Two Training Running.&quot; For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as &quot;Laurence&quot; instead of &quot;Larry.&quot; More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series &quot;Tribeca,&quot; he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies I ragazzi di Tuskegee (1995) and Il colore del sangue (1997).On the larger screen, both Laurence and Angela Bassett were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the film Tina - What&apos;s Love Got to Do with It (1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, Keanu Reeves&apos; mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi Matrix (1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels. Into the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in 20/20 Target Criminale (2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play &quot;Riff Raff,&quot; which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; as Henry II opposite Stockard Channing&apos;s Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in In cerca di Bobby Fischer (1993); a military prisoner in Uomini al passo (1990); a college professor in Singleton&apos;s L&apos;universitÃ  dell&apos;odio (1995); a CIA operative in Bad Company (1995); the title role in Othello (1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror Punto di non ritorno (1997); a Depression-era gangster in Hoodlum (1997); a dogged police sergeant in Clint Eastwood&apos;s Mystic River (2003); a spelling bee coach in Una parola per un sogno (2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream films Predators (2010) and Contagion (2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show &quot;Thurgood&quot; and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later transferred to the screen.In the fall of 2008, Fishburne replaced William Petersen as the male lead investigator on the popular CBS drama CSI - Scena del crimine (2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced by Ted Danson. Since then Fishburne has appeared in the Superman film L&apos;uomo d&apos;acciaio (2013) as Daily Planet chief Perry White.Fishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress Hajna O. Moss. In September 2002, Fishburne married Cuban-American actress Gina Torres.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in New York City to legendary screen star Henry Fonda and Ontario-born New York socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw, Jane Seymour Fonda was destined early to an uncommon and influential life in the limelight. Although she initially showed little inclination to follow her father&apos;s trade, she was prompted by Joshua Logan to appear with her father in the 1954 Omaha Community Theatre production of &quot;The Country Girl&quot;. Her interest in acting grew after meeting Lee Strasberg in 1958 and joining the Actors Studio. Her screen debut in In punta di piedi (1960) (directed by Logan) marked the beginning of a highly successful and respected acting career highlighted by two Academy Awards for her performances in Una squillo per l&apos;ispettore Klute (1971) and Tornando a casa (1978), and five Oscar nominations for Best Actress in Non si uccidono cosÃ¬ anche i cavalli? (1969), Giulia (1977), Sindrome cinese (1979), Il mattino dopo (1986) and Sul lago dorato (1981), which was the only film she made with her father. Her professional success contrasted with her personal life, which was often laden with scandal and controversy. Her appearance in several risquÃ© movies (including Barbarella (1968)) by then-husband Roger Vadim was followed by what was to become her most debated and controversial period: her espousal of anti-establishment causes and especially her anti-war activities during the Vietnam War. Her political involvement continued with fellow activist and husband Tom Hayden in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the 1980s she started the aerobic exercise craze with the publication of the &quot;Jane Fonda&apos;s Workout Book&quot;. She and Hayden divorced, and she married broadcasting mogul Ted Turner in 1991.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jonathan Scott Frakes was born on August 19, 1952 in Bellefonte, in central Pennsylvania. He is the son of Doris J. (Yingling) and Dr. James R. Frakes, a professor. His parents moved with Jonathan and his younger brother Daniel to Bethlehem in eastern Pennsylvania. There, his father taught English at Lehigh University, where he held the Fairchild chair in American Literature until his passing in 2002. Frakes is of German, and some English, ancestry.While growing up Jonathan was introduced to jazz by his father and started playing the trombone when he was in fourth grade. As a child Jonathan was always friendly, funny and somewhat of an actor according to a childhood friend. In high school he played in the band and ran track. He graduated from Liberty High in Bethlehem in 1970. The day after he graduated he started classes at Pennsylvania State University, enrolling as a psychology major. The next summer he worked as an usher for the local theater and observed his peers thoroughly enjoying acting. He was motivated to switch his major to theater arts and graduated with a bachelor&apos;s degree in 1974. He then moved to Boston to attain his masters degree from Harvard University by 1976.At this point he decided to move to New York City and try to make it as an actor. The roles did not come easily so he had to take side jobs, such as a waiter, a furniture mover (where he injured up his back), and a stint as Captain America for Marvel Comics. Meanwhile he won roles in the Broadway musical &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and on the soap opera The Doctors (1969) as Vietnam veteran Tom Carroll from 1977 to 1978. At his agent&apos;s urging Jonathan moved to Los Angeles in late 1978 to try his hand at television guest appearances. He guest-starred on several of the big prime-time shows of the time, including Charlie&apos;s Angels (1976), Fantasilandia (1977), Barnaby Jones (1973), Quincy (1976), Autostop per il cielo (1984), Una famiglia americana (1972), and Hazzard (1979).During the 1980s Jonathan landed a starring role in a prime-time soap opera, Il profumo del potere (1983), which had spun off a successful miniseries of the same name. However the show did not take off with the viewers and was soon canceled. He went back to guest appearances for two more years until he got the part of Stanley Hazard in the Civil War epic Nord e sud (1985). After spending more than six months filming all over the southern United States, he and his co-star, Genie Francis, fell in love (he had met her three years before when they co-starred in Il profumo del potere (1983)). During that time he and Genie didn&apos;t have much to do with each other, other than his making fun of her hair, according to her. However three years later they were an item.In early 1987 Jonathan went to an audition for a new television series at the urging of his soon-to-be wife and her family. After six weeks, and seven auditions, he won the role that would bring him worldwide fame: that of Commander William Riker on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). It was at this time, he and Genie announced their engagement. They would have to postpone their wedding twice because of his job but were finally married in the first-season hiatus on May 28, 1988. All of his new co-stars attended the wedding, along with Star Trek (1966) creator Gene Roddenberry. During the seven years Frakes starred on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), he not only acted but discovered that he had a talent for directing. He helmed eight episodes in all and was invited to direct on the Next Generation spin-offs, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Star Trek: Voyager (1995).The day after his 42nd birthday, on August 20, his son, Jameson Ivor Frakes, was born. Jameson is named after both his grandfathers, the late James Frakes and the late actor Ivor Francis, Genie&apos;s father. During this time Jonathan actually turned down work, preferring to stay at home and raise his son with his wife. For the next two years he did a few guest appearances on television.In 1996 it was announced that he was to be the director of the next Star Trek film, Primo contatto (1996). He received critical praise for his work on the film and it became the highest-grossing entry of the franchise to date. He formed a production company, Goepp Circle Productions, named after the street he lived on in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Just two days after his ninth wedding anniversary in 1997, Elizabeth Francis Frakes was born. Sadly just two weeks prior Jonathan&apos;s brother, Daniel, passed away from pancreatic cancer. In 1998 he was asked to direct the ninth Star Trek film, Star Trek - L&apos;insurrezione (1998). Following mixed reviews for this film he continued to direct in movies and television, act in a few non-Star Trek roles, and starred in the tenth Star Trek film, Star Trek - La nemesi (2002).</rdfs:comment>

He is of Irish, Scottish, German, Czech, and French-Canadian ancestry. As his parents frequently moved, Brendan can claim affinity with Ottawa, Indianapolis, Detroit, Seattle, London and Rome. His early exposure to theatre, particularly in London, led him to Seattle&apos;s Cornish Institute. After graduation he found a minor role as Sailor #1 in River Phoenix&apos;s Dogfight: una storia d&apos;amore (1991), then somewhat more substantial roles in Il mio amico scongelato (1992) and Scuola d&apos;onore (1992). He expresses a preference for playing &quot;fish out of water&quot; men. Five more years of supporting work led finally to the title role in George re della giungla..? (1997), a role which fully utilized his charm and beefy good looks, as well as offering him a chance to show off his comic talents. He describes this role as the one which dramatically altered his career. Critical raves for his role in Demoni e dei (1998) pointed to yet another dimension to his dramatic persona.</rdfs:comment>

Famous for his public declaration of celibacy in the &quot;Tatler&quot; back in the 1980s, Emma Thompson has characterised her friend as &quot;90 percent gay, 10 percent other.&quot;Stephen Fry was born in Hampstead, London, to Marianne Eve (Newman) and Alan Fry, a physicist and inventor. His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants, while his father&apos;s family was of English background. He grew up in Norfolk and attended Uppingham School and Stout&apos;s Hill. After his notorious three months in Pucklechurch prison for credit card fraud, he attended Queens College, Cambridge in 1979, finishing with a 2:1 in English in 1981/2. While at Cambridge, he was a member of the Cherubs drinking club, and Footlights with Thompson, Tony Slattery, Martin Bergman, and Hugh Laurie (to whom he was introduced by E.T.). His prolific writing partnership with Laurie began in 1981 with resulting Footlights revues for (among others) Mayweek, Edinburgh Festival, and a three month tour of Australia. In 1984, Fry was engaged to do the rewrite of the Noel Gay musical &quot;Me and My Girl,&quot; which made him a millionaire before the age of 30. It also earned him a nomination for a Tony award in 1987. (Sidenote: It was upon SF&apos;s suggestion that Emma Thompson landed a leading role in the London cast of this show.) Throughout the 1980s, Fry did a huge amount of television and radio work, as well as writing for newspapers (e.g. a weekly column in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;) and magazines (e.g. articles for &quot;Arena&quot;). He is probably best known for his television roles in Blackadder II (1986) and Jeeves and Wooster (1990).His support of the Terence Higgins Trust through events such as the first &quot;Hysteria&quot; benefit, as well as numerous other charity efforts, are probably those works of which he is most proud. Fry&apos;s acting career has not been limited to films and television. He had successful runs in Alan Bennett&apos;s &quot;Forty Years On,&quot; Simon Gray&apos;s &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot; with John Sessions, Rik Mayall, John Gordon Sinclair, and others. Michael Frayn&apos;s &quot;Look Look&quot; and Gray&apos;s &quot;Cell Mates&quot; were less successful for both Fry and their playwrights, the latter not helped by his walking out of the play after only a couple of weeks. Fry has published four novels as well as a collection of his radio and journalistic miscellanea. He has recorded audiotapes of his novels (an unabridged version of &quot;The Liar&quot; was released in 1995), as well as many other works for both adults and children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Edward Walter Furlong was born in Glendale, California. His mother, Eleanor (Tafoya), is from a Mexican family, and worked at a youth center. Furlong had no acting ambitions until he was approached by casting agent Mali Finn, who was looking for a young actor to play the role of John Connor in what turned out to be one of the the biggest box-office hits of the 1990s, Terminator 2 - Il giorno del giudizio (1991). Finn instantly recognized his ability, and suggested him for the part, feeling that he could hold his own playing opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton.For his career-starting role, Furlong earned an MTV movie award for best breakthrough role, and a Saturn Sci-Fi award for best young actor. From there, he took an unconventional route through Hollywood, which led to his working with some of the top people in the business, in both studio and independent films. His work has included starring opposite Jeff Bridges in American Heart (1992) for which he was nominated for an IFP Spirit award for best supporting actor. He has also starred in Una casa tutta per noi (1993) with Kathy Bates, Little Odessa (1994) with Tim Roth, Storie d&apos;amore (1995) with Walter Matthau and Barbet Schroeder&apos;s Prima e dopo (1996).He also starred opposite Edward Norton in Tony Kaye&apos;s controversial and gripping drama American History X (1998) and in the hit comedy Pecker (1998). More recently, Furlong has been opposite Willem Dafoe in the prison drama Animal Factory (2000), directed by Steve Buscemi. He recently starred in Pupi Avati&apos;s 11th-century tale, I cavalieri che fecero l&apos;impresa (2001) (&quot;The Knights of the Quest&quot;).</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1956-04-12</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of Hollywood&apos;s most private and guarded leading men, Andy Garcia has created iconic characters while at the same time staying true to his acting roots and personal projects.Garcia was born AndrÃ©s Arturo GarcÃ­a MenÃ©ndez on April 12, 1956, in Havana, Cuba, to Amelie MenÃ©ndez, a teacher of English, and RenÃ© GarcÃ­a NÃºÃ±ez, an attorney and avocado farmer. Garcia&apos;s family was relatively affluent. However, when he was two years old, Fidel Castro came to power, and the family fled to Miami Beach. Forced to work menial jobs for a while, the family started a fragrance company that was eventually worth more than a million dollars. He attended Natilus Junior High School and later at Miami Beach Senior High School. Andy was a popular student in school, a good basketball player and good-looking. He dreamed of playing professional baseball. In his senior year, though, he contracted mononucleosis and hepatitis, and unable to play sports, he turned his attention to acting.He studied acting with Jay W. Jensen. Jensen was a South Florida legend, counting among his numerous students, Brett Ratner, Roy Firestone, Mickey Rourke, and Luther Campbell. Following his positive high school experiences in acting, he continued his drama studies at Florida International University.Soon, he was headed out to Hollywood. His first break came as a gang member on the very first episode of the popular TV series Hill Street giorno e notte (1981). His role as a cocaine kingpin in 8 milioni di modi per morire (1986) put him on the radar of Brian De Palma, who was casting for his gangster classic The Untouchables - Gli intoccabili (1987). At first, he envisioned Garcia as Al Capone&apos;s sadistic henchman Frank Nitti, but fearing typecasting as a gangster, Garcia campaigned for the role of &quot;George Stone&quot;, the Italian cop who gets accepted into Eliot Ness&apos; famous band of lawmen. Garcia&apos;s next notable role came in Black Rain - Pioggia sporca (1989) by acclaimed director Ridley Scott, as the partner of police detective Michael Douglas. He then co-starred with Richard Gere in Affari sporchi (1990), directed by Mike Figgis. In 1989, Francis Ford Coppola was casting for the highly anticipated third installment of his &quot;Godfather&quot; films. Il padrino - Parte III (1990) included one of the most sought-after roles in decades, the hot-headed son of &quot;Sonny Corleone&quot; and mob protÃ©gÃ© of &quot;Michael Corloene&quot;, &quot;Vincent Mancini&quot;. A plum role for any young rising star, the role was campaigned for by a host of actors. Val Kilmer, Alec Baldwin, Vincent Spano, Charlie Sheen, and even Robert De Niro (who wanted the role changed to accommodate his age) were all beaten out by the up-and-coming Garcia. His performance was Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actor, and secured him international stardom and a place in cinematic history. Now a leading man, he starred in such films as Gli occhi del delitto (1992) and Eroe per caso (1992). He won raves for his role as the husband of Meg Ryan in Amarsi (1994) and gave another charismatic gangster turn in Cosa fare a Denver quando sei morto (1995). He then returned in Prove apparenti (1996), directed by Sidney Lumet, as well as portraying legendary mobster Lucky Luciano in Hoodlum (1997). In perhaps his most mainstream role, he portrayed a cop in the action film Soluzione estrema (1998). Garcia then starred in a few lower-profile projects that didn&apos;t do much for his career, but things turned around in 2001, with the first of many projects being his role as a cold casino owner in Ocean&apos;s Eleven - Fate il vostro gioco (2001), directed by Steven Soderbergh. Seeing his removal from Cuba as involuntary, Garcia is proud of his heritage which influences his life and work. One such case is his portrayal of renowned Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval in The Arturo Sandoval Story (2000). He is an extremely private man, and strong believer in old-fashioned chivalry. Married to his wife, Maria Victoria, since 1982, the couple has three daughters. One of the most talented leading men around, Garcia has had a unique career of staying true to his own ideals and thoughts on acting. While some would have used some of the momentum he has acquired at different points in his career to get rich off lightweight projects, Garcia has stayed true to stories and films that aspire to something more. But with a presence and style that never seem old, a respect from directors and film buffs, alike, Andy Garcia will be remembered for a long time in film history.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Janeane, the petite woman with the acerbic wit, was born in Newton, New Jersey, in 1964, to Joan, a secretary, and Carmine Garofalo, an Exxon executive. She is of Italian and Irish descent. Janeane had many jobs before breaking into show biz. She worked as a bike messenger, a shoe saleswoman, waitress and temp secretary. Watching David Letterman on TV inspired her to write comedy, and by 1985 she was doing stand up comedy. As such, Janeane has become a cult figure, giving a voice to a generation, venting her frustration at T.V., romance, life in general and anything that ticks her off in particular. Janeane did sketches on The Ben Stiller Show (1992) (an Emmy-winning, but canceled show). She would continue to collaborate with Ben Stiller in future projects. Janeane received 2 Emmy nominations for her work on The Larry Sanders Show (1992), developing her signature character: a smart, cynical woman with a razor wit. She was not happy with her Il Saturday Night Live (1975) stint in 1994, and was vocal about it (of course). Transferring her persona from TV to the big screen, she moved on to movies, basically playing the character she had defined for herself. In Romy &amp; Michelle (1997) she portrayed a smart, cynical, successful businesswomen with a razor wit, and this time with swear words (in the movie she had developed a brand of cigarettes with fast-burning paper, for the gal on the go; in real life it is alleged she smokes Marlboros). Janeane continues to work in TV and movies, often collaborating with Ben Stiller in a number of movies like Mystery Men (1999), his easygoing style being a counterpoint to her caustic nature.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Teri Garr can claim a career in show business by birthright. She was born in Lakewood, Ohio, the daughter of Eddie Garr (born Edward Leo Gonnoud), a Broadway stage and film actor, and Phyllis Garr (nÃ©e Emma Schmotzer), a dancer. Her maternal grandparents were Austrian, and her father was of Irish descent.While she was still an infant, her family moved from Hollywood to New Jersey but, after the death of her father when she was 11, the family returned to Hollywood, where her mother became a wardrobe mistress for movies and television. While Garr&apos;s dancing can be seen in nine Elvis Presley movies, her first speaking role in motion pictures was in the 1968 feature Sogni perduti (1968), starring The Monkees. In the 1970s she became well established in television with appearances on shows such as Star Trek (1966), Operazione ladro (1968) and Uno sceriffo a New York (1970), and became a semi-regular on The Sonny and Cher Show (1976) as Cher&apos;s friend, Olivia. Garr has since risen to become one of Hollywood&apos;s most versatile, energetic and well-recognized actresses. She has starred in many memorable films, including Frankenstein Junior (1974), Bentornato Dio! (1977), Incontri ravvicinati del terzo tipo (1977), Mister mamma (1983), Fuori orario (1985) and her Academy Award-nominated performance for Best Supporting Actress in Tootsie (1982). Other film roles include Black Stallion (1979), Un sogno lungo un giorno (1981), 60 minuti per Danny Masters (1982), Firstborn (1984), Felice e vincente (1989), L&apos;ultima luna d&apos;agosto (1988), Il macellaio (1989), Come Ã¨ difficile farsi ammazzare (1990), Aspettando la luce (1990), Mom and Dad Save the World (1992), Alibi perfetto (1995), PrÃªt-Ã -Porter (1994) and Un semplice desiderio (1997).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">While he&apos;s never been a typical leading man, Crispin Glover has distinguished himself as one of the most intriguing personalities in the movie business. His unusual characters and personal projects have inspired a cult-like following that has dubbed him both madman and genius.The son of actress and dancer Betty Glover and actor Bruce Glover, Crispin Hellion Glover was born in New York City and raised in Southern California. He was named after the Saint Crispin&apos;s Day speech in Shakespeare&apos;s Henry V. His middle name, Hellion, was also used by his father. Crispin picked up his father&apos;s trade while still in elementary school--by age thirteen, he already had an agent scouting out parts. A lead in a stage production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (starring Florence Henderson) led to guest spots on the TV shows Happy Days (1974), Hill Street giorno e notte (1981) and Casa Keaton (1982), which in turn led to roles in made-for-TV movies. The adolescent Glover felt &quot;confined&quot; by TV work, however, so he opted to stick to movie parts. He made his big-screen debut in the teen hi-jinx movie in Kiss Games (1983), then followed up with a supporting role in VenerdÃ¬ 13 - Capitolo finale (1984).Glover&apos;s most defining Hollywood moment happened the next year, when he appeared as George McFly (Michael J. Fox&apos;s father) in the instant classic Ritorno al futuro (1985). The underdog character struck a chord with moviegoers. Oddly enough, the actor delivered one of his favorite performances around the same time--playing a small-town kid obsessed with Olivia Newton-John in the indie The Orkly Kid (1985)--but the smaller film was completely overshadowed by his commercial success. Glover did, however, receive critical praise for his next indie role, a starring turn as a high-strung murder witness in I ragazzi del fiume (1986). Glover and the producers did not come to a financial agreement for him to reprise the role of George McFly in Ritorno al futuro - Parte II (1989). The producers brought the character back to life by splicing together archived footage and new scenes (using an actor in prosthetic makeup). Glover, who hadn&apos;t given permission for his likeness to be used, sued the film&apos;s producer, Steven Spielberg, and won. The case prompted the Screen Actors Guild to devise new regulations about the use of actors&apos; images.In 1990 Glover teamed up with fellow eccentric David Lynch to play the maniacal Cousin Dell in Cuore selvaggio (1990). He filled the next decade with similarly quirky, peripheral roles, including a turn as Andy Warhol in The Doors (1991) and a cameo as a train fireman in Jim Jarmusch&apos;s Dead Man (1995). His small but memorable appearances in films like Buon compleanno Mr. Grape (1993), Cowgirl - Il nuovo sesso (1993) and Larry Flynt - Oltre lo scandalo (1996) often outshone the main action.When he&apos;s not stealing scenes from Hollywood hotshots, Glover pours his considerable energy into other creative endeavors. He wrote his first book, &quot;Billow Rock&quot;, before age 18, and since then he&apos;s gone on to create a library of peculiar titles (several of which have been published through his family&apos;s Volcanic Eruptions press). Among his most famous volumes are &quot;Rat Catching&quot; and &quot;Oak-Mot&quot;, both Victorian-era stories updated with macabre illustrations and cut-up text. In 1989 he released an album of spoken word readings and cover tunes (including a rendition of &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&apos;&quot;) entitled &quot;The Big Problem [does not equal] the Solution. The Solution = Let it be.&quot;In 1995 Glover began shooting his directorial debut, What Is It? (2005), a surreal film populated entirely by actors with Down&apos;s Syndrome. He tours with the film and its sequel It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine. (2007) and his show, &quot;Crispin Hellion Glover&apos;s Big Slide Show,&quot; which is a one hour dramatic narration of eight different profusely illustrated books. The artist in Glover has been said to be inspired by &quot;the aesthetic of discomfort,&quot; a theme which seems to have been carried over into an artistic public performance on David Letterman&apos;s NBC show in 1987, Glover emerged wearing a wig and platform shoes, then delivered a swift kick toward Letterman&apos;s head that prompted the producers to cut to a commercial. Late 2000 saw him hitting the multiplex with roles in Betty Love (2000) and Charlie&apos;s Angels (2000), and the titular Willard (2003). He re-teamed with Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis as Grendel in Beowulf (2007) and has worked with Johnny Depp for the third time in Tim Burton&apos;s Alice in Wonderland (2010). Other Glover projects loom on the not-too-distant horizon.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Actor, producer and humanitarian Danny Glover has been a commanding presence on screen, stage and television for more than 35 years.Glover was born in San Francisco, California, to Carrie (Hunley) and James Glover, postal workers who were also active in civil rights. Glover trained at the Black Actors&apos; Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. It was his Broadway debut in Fugard&apos;s Master Harold...and the Boys, which brought him to national recognition and led director Robert Benton to cast Glover in his first leading role in 1984&apos;s OscarÂ®-nominated Best Picture Places in the Heart.The following year, Glover starred in two more Best Picture nominees: Peter Weir&apos;s Witness and Steven Spielberg&apos;s The Color Purple. In 1987, Glover partnered with Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon film and went on to star in three hugely successful Lethal Weapon sequels. Glover has also invested his talents in more personal projects, including the award-winning To Sleep With Anger, which he executive produced and for which he won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor; Bopha!; Manderlay; Missing in America; and the film version of Athol Fugard&apos;s play Boesman and Lena. On the small screen, Glover won an Image Award and a Cable ACE Award and earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in the title role of the HBO movie Mandela. He has also received Emmy nominations for his work in the acclaimed miniseries Lonesome Dove and the telefilm Freedom Song. As a director, he earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for Showtime&apos;s Just a Dream.Glover&apos;s film credits range from the blockbuster Lethal Weapon franchise to smaller independent features, some of which Glover also produced. He co-starred in the critically acclaimed feature Dreamgirls directed by Bill Condon and in Po&apos; Boy&apos;s Game for director Clement Virgo. He appeared in the hit feature Shooter for director Antoine Fuqua, Honeydripper for director John Sayles, and Be Kind, Rewind for director Michel Gondry.Glover has also gained respect for his wide-reaching community activism and philanthropic efforts, with a particular emphasis on advocacy for economic justice, and access to health care and education programs in the United States and Africa. For these efforts, Glover received a 2006 DGA Honor. Internationally, Glover has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program from 1998-2004, focusing on issues of poverty, disease, and economic development in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and serves as UNICEF Ambassador.In 2005, Glover co-founded Louverture Films dedicated to the development and production of films of historical relevance, social purpose, commercial value and artistic integrity. The New York based company has a slate of progressive features and documentaries including Trouble the Water, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, Africa Unite, award winning feature Bamako, and most recent projects Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, and The Disappearance of McKinley Nolan.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jean-Luc Godard was born in Paris on December 3, 1930, the second of four children in a bourgeois Franco-Swiss family. His father was a doctor who owned a private clinic, and his mother came from a preeminent family of Swiss bankers. During World War II Godard became a naturalized citizen of Switzerland and attended school in Nyons (Switzerland). His parents divorced in 1948, at which time he returned to Paris to attend the LycÃ©e Rohmer. In 1949 he studied at the Sorbonne to prepare for a degree in ethnology. However, it was during this time that he began attending with FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette, and Ã‰ric Rohmer.In 1950 Godard, with Rivette and Rohmer, founded &quot;Gazette du cinÃ©ma&quot;, which published five issues between May and November. He wrote a number of articles for the journal, often using the pseudonym &quot;Hans Lucas&quot;. After Godard worked on and financed two films by Rivette and Rohmer, Godard&apos;s family cut off their financial support in 1951, and he resorted to a Bohemian lifestyle that included stealing food and money when necessary. In January 1952 he began writing film criticism for &quot;Les cahiers du cinÃ©ma&quot;. Later that year he traveled to North and South America with his father and attempted to make his first film (of which only a tracking shot from a car was ever accomplished).In 1953 he returned to Paris briefly before securing a job as a construction worker on a dam project in Switzerland. With the money from the job, he made a short film in 1954 about the building of the dam called OpÃ©ration &apos;BÃ©ton&apos; (1958) (&quot;Operation Concrete&quot;). Later that year his mother was killed in a motor scooter accident in Switzerland. In 1956 Godard began writing again for &quot;Les cahiers du cinÃ©ma&quot; as well as for the journal &quot;Arts&quot;. In 1957 Godard worked as the press attache for &quot;Artistes AssociÃ©s&quot;, and made his first French film, Charlotte et VÃ©ronique, ou Tous les garÃ§ons s&apos;appellent Patrick (1959) (aka &quot;Charlotte et VÃ©ronique&quot;).In 1958 he shot Charlotte et son Jules (1960) (&quot;Charlotte and Her Boyfriend&quot;), his homage to Jean Cocteau. Later that year he took unused footage of a flood in Paris shot by Truffaut and edited it into a film called Une histoire d&apos;eau (1961) (&quot;A Story of Water&quot;), which was an homage to Mack Sennett. In 1959 he worked with Truffaut on the weekly publication &quot;Temps de Paris&quot;. Godard wrote a gossip column for the journal, but also spent much time writing scenarios for films and a body of critical writings which placed him firmly in the forefront of the &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; aesthetic, precursing the French New Wave.It was also in that year Godard began work on Fino all&apos;ultimo respiro (1960) (&quot;Breathless&quot;). In 1960 he married Anna Karina in Switzerland. In April and May he shot Le petit soldat (1963) in Geneva and was preparing the film for a fall release in Paris. However, French censors banned it due to its references to the Algerian war, and it was not shown until 1963. In March 1960 Fino all&apos;ultimo respiro (1960) premiered in Paris. It was hugely successful both with the film critics and at the box office, and became a landmark film in the French New Wave with its references to American cinema, its jagged editing and overall romantic/cinephilia approach to filmmaking. The film propelled the popularity of male lead Jean-Paul Belmondo with European audiences.In 1961 Godard shot La donna Ã¨ donna (1961), his first film using color widescreen stock. Later that year he participated in the collective effort to remake the film I sette peccati capitali (1961), which was heralded as an important project in artistic collaboration. In 1962 Godard shot Questa Ã¨ la mia vita (1962) in Paris, his first commercial success since &quot;Ã€ bout de souffle&quot;. Later that year he shot a segment entitled &quot;Le Nouveau Monde&quot; for the collective film Ro.Go.Pa.G. (1963), another important work in the history of collaborative multiple-authored art.In 1963 Godard completed a film in homage to Jean Vigo entitled Les carabiniers (1963), which was a resounding failure with the public and stirred furious controversy with film critics. Also that year he worked on a couple of collective films: Le piÃ¹ belle truffe del mondo (1964) (from which Godard&apos;s sequence was later cut) and Parigi di notte (1965). In 1964 Godard and his wife Anna Karina formed their own production company, Anouchka Films. They shot a film called Una donna sposata (1964), which censors forced them to re-edit due to a topless sunbathing scene shot by Jacques Rozier. The censors also made Godard change the title to &quot;Une femme mariÃ©&quot; so as to not give the impression that this &quot;scandalous&quot; woman was the typical French wife. Later in the year, two French television programs were produced in devotion to Godard&apos;s work.In the spring of 1965 Godard shot Agente Lemmy Caution: Missione Alphaville (1965) in Paris; in the summer he shot Il bandito delle 11 (1965) in Paris and the south of France. Shortly thereafter he and Anna Karina separated. Following their divorce, Godard shot Una storia americana (1966), &quot;Deux ou trois choses que je sais d&apos;elle (1966)&quot;, &quot;L&apos;amour en l&apos;an 2000&quot; (1966) (a sequel to &quot;Alphaville&quot; shot as a sketch for the collective film &quot;L&apos;amour travers les ages&quot; (1966)).In 1967 Godard shot La cinese (1967) in Paris with Anne Wiazemsky, who was the granddaughter of French novelist FranÃ§ois Mauriac. During the making of the film Godard and Wiazemsky were married in Paris. Later in the year he was prevented from traveling to North Vietnam for the shooting of a sequence for the collective film Lontano dal Vietnam (1967). He instead shot the sequence in Paris, entitled &quot;Camera-Oeil&quot;. Also during 1967 Godard participated (as the only Frenchman) on an Italian collective film called Amore e rabbia (1969).In 1968 Godard was commissioned by French television to make La gaia scienza (1969). However, television producers were so outraged by the product Godard produced that they refused to show it. In May of that year Henri Langlois was fired by the head of the French Jean-Pierre Gorin to form the Dziga-Vertov group, infuriating Godard. He became increasingly concerned with socialist solutions to an idealist cinema, especially in providing the proletariat with the means of production and distribution. Along with other militantly political filmmakers in the Dziga-Vertov group, Godard published a series of &apos;CinÃ©-Tracts&apos; outlining these viewpoints. In the summer of 1968 Godard traveled to New York City and Berkeley, California, to shoot the film &quot;One American Movie&quot;, which was never completed. In September he made a trip to Canada to start another film called &quot;Communication(s)&quot;, which also went unfinished, and then made a visit to Cuba before returning to France.In 1969 Godard traveled to England, where he made the film British Sounds (1970) for BBC Weekend Television, but the network later refused to show it. In the late spring he traveled with the Dziga-Vertov group to Prague to secretly shoot the film &quot;Pravda&quot;. Later that year he shot Lotte in Italia (1971) (&quot;Struggle for Italy&quot;) for Italian television. It was never shown, either.In 1970 Godard traveled to Lebanon to shoot a film for the Palestinian Liberation Organization entitled &quot;Jusque Ã  la victoire&quot; (1970) (&quot;Until Victory&quot;). Later that year he traveled to dozens of American universities trying to raise money for the film. In spite of his efforts, it was never released.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cuba Gooding Jr. was born on January 2, 1968, in The Bronx, New York. His mother, Shirley (Sullivan), was a backup singer for The Sweethearts. His father, Cuba Gooding, was the lead vocalist for the R&amp;B group The Main Ingredient, which had a hit with the song &quot;Everybody Plays The Fool&quot;. His paternal grandfather was from Barbados.Cuba&apos;s father moved the family to Los Angeles in 1972, only to leave them a few years later. Despite this setback, Cuba was able to maintain a positive outlook and overachieved throughout school. He attended four different high schools and was elected class president in three of them. While at high school, Cuba met and fell in love with Sara Kapfer, whom he later lived with for seven years before tying the knot in March 1994.Following high school, Cuba studied Japanese martial arts for three years before turning his focus toward acting. Early on, he landed guest starring roles on shows like Hill Street giorno e notte (1981) and MacGyver (1985). His first major role was in the 1991 box office surprise Boyz n the Hood - Strade violente (1991). He followed this success with supporting roles in major films like Codice d&apos;onore (1992), Jack colpo di fulmine (1994) and Virus letale (1995).In 1996, Cuba was cast as an arrogant but loyal football player in the Tom Cruise-Cameron Crowe film Jerry Maguire (1996). The film became a huge box office smash and earned Cuba an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His &quot;Show Me The Money&quot; line in the movie became a nationwide catchphrase. The role elevated him to superstar status, as many of Hollywood&apos;s top producers began to &quot;show him the money&quot; to appear in their films.Since Jerry Maguire (1996), Cuba has managed to keep busy with a wide range of roles alongside many of Hollywood&apos;s biggest stars. Most recently, he won critical support for his portrayal of a mentally handicapped man in the heartwarming film Mi chiamano Radio (2003), another movie about football. In 2002, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.He resides in Studio City, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Hugh Grant, one of Britain&apos;s best known faces, has been equally entertaining on-screen as well as in real life, and has had enough sense of humor to survive a media frenzy. He is known for his roles in Quattro matrimoni e un funerale (1994), with Andie MacDowell, Notting Hill (1999), opposite Julia Roberts, and Scrivimi una canzone (2007), opposite Drew Barrymore, among his other works.He was born Hugh John Mungo Grant on September 9, 1960, in Hammersmith, London, United Kingdom. His mother, Fyvola Susan (MacLean), was a teacher. His father, James Murray Grant, was an artist and carpet salesman, and his grandfather was in the British Army during WWII. He is of mostly Scottish and English descent, with many recent ancestors who were prominent in the military. Young Grant was fond of literature and acting. He won a scholarship to Oxford, going up to New College in 1979. There he was involved in student drama, and considered a career as an art historian. After Oxford, he turned down a scholarship to do postgraduate studies in Art History at the Courtauld Institute in London, and focused on his acting career. In 1982, while still a student, Grant made his big screen debut in Privileged (1982) by director Michael Hoffman.Grant&apos;s breakthrough came with the leading role as Charles in Quattro matrimoni e un funerale (1994), opposite Andie MacDowell, a role which won him a Golden Globe Award, as well as a BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor. During the 1990s Grant established himself as a very original and resourceful actor. He played a string of characters projecting a positive mindset, showing how do you stay optimistic when you are actually worried about a cascade of troubles. Grant had his own experience as a survivor of an unfortunate episode in his private life, which he managed to overcome thanks to having a pretty damn good outlook on life.His forte is playing characters projecting warmth and sincere happiness, with his hallmark stuttering, albeit some accused him of reprising the same character he has been playing for the past two decades. Grant&apos;s ability to show his character development within a limited screen time shines in Love Actually - L&apos;amore davvero (2003), with his witty portrayal of a Prime Minister whose personal insecurities become intertwined with his country&apos;s international affairs, a performance that earned him a nomination for European Audience Award. His screen presence and skillful understatement takes his characters beyond the written script, thanks to his mastery of timing and effortless style.Outside of his acting profession, Grant has been a good athlete, he played cricket and football in his younger years. He enjoys playing golf, frequently taking part in Pro-Am tournaments. He has been an avid art lover since his younger years, and has been collecting fine art, a passion he inherited from his father.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Pam Grier was born in Winston-Salem, NC, one of four children of Gwendolyn Sylvia (Samuels), a nurse, and Clarence Ransom Grier Jr., an Air Force mechanic. Pam has been a major African-American star from the early 1970s. Her career started in 1971, when Roger Corman of New World Pictures launched her with Sesso in gabbia (1971), about a women&apos;s penitentiary, and The Big Bird Cage (1972). Her strong role put her into a five-year contract with Samuel Z. Arkoff of American-International Pictures, and she became a leading lady in action films such as Jack Hill&apos;s Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974), the comic strip character Assassinio all&apos;aeroporto (1975) and William Girdler&apos;s &apos;Sheba, Baby&apos; (1975). She continued working with American-International, where she portrayed William Marshall&apos;s vampire victim in the Blacula (1972) sequel, Scream Blacula Scream (1973).During the 1980s she became a regular on Miami Vice (1984) and played a supporting role as an evil witch in Ray Bradbury&apos;s and Walt Disney Pictures&apos; Qualcosa di sinistro sta per accadere (1983), then returned to action as Steven Seagal&apos;s partner in Nico (1988). Her most famous role of the 1990s was probably Jackie Brown (1997), directed by Quentin Tarantino, which was an homage to her earlier 1970s action roles, She occasionally did supporting roles, as in Tim Burton&apos;s Mars Attacks! (1996), In Too Deep (1999) and a funny performance in Amiche cattive (1999). She also appeared in John Carpenter&apos;s Fantasmi da Marte (2001) and co-starred with Snoop Dogg in Bones (2001). Her entire career of over 30 years has brought only success for this beautiful and talented actress.A sister of Grier&apos;s died from cancer in 1990 and the son of that sister committed suicide because of his mother&apos;s illness. Pam herself was diagnosed with cancer in 1988 and given 18 months to live, which has had an effect on how she has chosen to live.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David Wark Griffith was born in rural Kentucky to Jacob &quot;Roaring Jake&quot; Griffith, a former Confederate Army colonel and Civil War veteran. Young Griffith grew up with his father&apos;s romantic war stories and melodramatic nineteenth-century literature that were to eventually shape his movies. In 1897 Griffith set out to pursue a career both acting and writing for the theater, but for the most part was unsuccessful. Reluctantly, he agreed to act in the new motion picture medium for Edwin S. Porter at the Edison Company. Griffith was eventually offered a job at the financially struggling American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph Co., where he directed over four hundred and fifty short films, experimenting with the story-telling techniques he would later perfect in his epic Nascita di una nazione (1915).Griffith and his personal cinematographer G.W. Bitzer collaborated to create and perfect such cinematic devices as the flashback, the iris shot, the mask and cross-cutting. In the years following &quot;Birth&quot;, Griffith never again saw the same monumental success as his signature film and, in 1931, his increasing failures forced his retirement. Though hailed for his vision in narrative film-making, he was similarly criticized for his blatant racism. Griffith died in Los Angeles in 1948, one of the most dichotomous figures in film history.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1957-08-09</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Melanie Griffith was born on August 9, 1957 in New York City, to then model/future actress Tippi Hedren and former child actor turned advertising executive Peter Griffith. Her parents&apos; marriage ended when she was four years old and Tippi brought Melanie to Los Angeles to get a new start. Tippi caught the eye of the great director Alfred Hitchcock, who gave her starring roles in Gli uccelli (1963) and Marnie (1964). She married her then-agent, Noel Marshall, in 1964 (they divorced in 1982), and Melanie grew up with three stepbrothers. Meanwhile, her father married Nanita Greene Samuels and had two more children: Tracy Griffith and Clay A. Griffith.Melanie also grew up with tigers and lions, as Tippi and Noel were raising them for the movie Il grande ruggito (1981), in which the family later starred. Melanie&apos;s acting career, however, began as a model at just nine months old in a commercial and she later appeared as an extra in Smith! Un cowboy per gli indiani (1969) and The Harrad Experiment (1973), where she fell in love with her mother&apos;s co-star, Don Johnson. She was only 14 years old, while he was a 22-year-old with two annulled marriages. Tippi took a very liberal approach and allowed Melanie to move in with Don at a tender age. Even though Melanie didn&apos;t like modeling, she continued to do it to pay the bills. One day she went to meet with director Arthur Penn for what she thought was a modeling assignment. It was actually an audition for his film Bersaglio di notte (1975), and Penn gave her the role of a runaway nymphet. She was hesitant, but Johnson encouraged her to take the role. She agreed but was terrified of performing in front of the camera. Penn took a paternal interest in her, and she felt confident and gave a riveting performance, doing racy nude scenes. It immediately typecast her and led to more nymphet roles, with her beautiful nude body a permanent fixture in movies like Ha-Gan (1977) and La ragazza dell&apos;altro (1977). She also married Johnson, eloping in 1976, but the union ended within six months.Unfortunately, as her career progressed, she became increasingly dependent on drugs and alcohol, a fact well-known to studio executives, who stopped considering her for feature film roles. Melanie started doing television work, where she met her second husband, Steven Bauer, on the set of the TV movie La donna soldato (1981). He helped her to overcome her drug and alcohol problems and got her to take acting classes with Stella Adler in New York. The classes paid off, as director Brian De Palma cast her as a porno actress in his murder mystery Omicidio a luci rosse (1984) and her sexy, funny performance won her rave reviews and the Best Supporting Actress Award by the National Society of Film Critics and a Golden Globe nomination. Jonathan Demme was so impressed with her performance that he gave her the female lead in Qualcosa di travolgente (1986) without even auditioning her. The film was a commercial failure but quickly became a cult favorite on video and cable, with Melanie again getting critical plaudits and a Golden Globe nomination.The birth of her first child, Alexander, in 1985, didn&apos;t help to save her struggling marriage, and she and Bauer separated shortly thereafter. Melanie was given starring roles in Bambola meccanica mod. Cherry 2000 (1987) and Stormy Monday - LunedÃ¬ di tempesta (1988), but the films were barely released. Soon writers were asking when the public at large was going to take notice of this unique and talented actress. Melanie&apos;s career skyrocketed when Mike Nichols cast her as spunky secretary Tess McGill in Una donna in carriera (1988), a box-office hit for which she received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress and won the Golden Globe Award as Best Actress in a Comedy. However, her ongoing substance abuse had almost destroyed her career yet again, and Nichols pushed her into a rehabilitation clinic. En route to the clinic she called ex-husband Johnson for support, and they reconciled after her release from the clinic. She got pregnant, divorced Bauer and remarried Johnson in 1989, and later that year their daughter Dakota Johnson was born. A sober Melanie now concentrated on her film career: her follow-up to &quot;Working Girl&quot; was John Schlesinger&apos;s Hitchcockian urban thriller Uno sconosciuto alla porta (1990). It was a moderate success, but most of the films she chose flopped badly, especially Il falÃ² delle vanitÃ  (1990), which reunited her with director Brian De Palma. Even though she gave heartfelt performances in all her films, she was often miscast, with her breathy little-girl voice not helping matters in her role as a spy in Vite sospese (1992) and as a homicide detective going undercover in the Hassidic Jewish community in New York City in Una estranea fra noi (1992).Melanie was charming as a street hooker who befriends a group of elementary students in Lezioni di anatomia (1994), but the film received negative reviews and performed dismally at the box office. She made a minor comeback with the critics for her supporting role as a desperate housewife in La vita a modo mio (1994), which reunited her with Bruce Willis, her co-star in &quot;Bonfire&quot;, and Paul Newman, her co-star from Detective Harper: acqua alla gola (1975). She also earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work in the well-received TV miniseries Buffalo Girls (1995), followed by another hit film, the ensemble Amiche per sempre (1995). Her personal life was making headlines again, though, as she left Johnson because of his own substance-abuse problems, reconciled with him briefly when he became sober, only to leave him again, this time for Antonio Banderas, her married co-star from Two much - Uno di troppo (1995). Both she and Banderas created a scandal in 1995 with their torrid romance, and the tabloids followed their every move, including her divorce from Johnson and his divorce from wife Ana Leza. Melanie became pregnant with her third child, and she and Banderas married in 1996. Their daughter Stella Banderas was born, and the notorious couple were forgiven by the public and the media.Melanie won strong reviews in independent films like Un altro giorno in paradiso (1998), where she played a heroin-using criminal accomplice on the run, and the made-for-cable movie RKO 281 - La vera storia di Quarto potere (1999), in which she portrayed actress Marion Davies, a part that garnered her Golden Globe and Emmy nominations as Best Supporting Actress. Melanie became dependent to pain killers, however, returning to rehab in 2000. She wrote about her struggle and recovery in her journal on her official website. Greenmoon Productions, the production company that she formed with Banderas, produced several flops, such as her starring vehicle Pazzi in Alabama (1999), directed by Banderas. Her career took another blow when her TV series, Me &amp; George (1998), never even aired. After making A morte Hollywood (2000) and Vite nascoste (2000), Melanie did a voice-over role in Stuart Little 2 (2002) and played supporting roles in minor films Tempo (2003), as Sylvester Stallone&apos;s girlfriend in Shade - Carta vincente (2003), and as Barbara Marx in The Night We Called It a Day (2003) with Dennis Hopper playing Frank Sinatra, but none of these films made a ripple at the box office. As a result, film and television offers dried up.In 2003, a resourceful Melanie turned to the Broadway stage, and packed houses with her turn as the murderess &quot;Roxie Hart&quot; in the musical &quot;Chicago,&quot; for which she received a rave review from the New York Times theater critic. It renewed her confidence, as she had never sang, danced or been on the Broadway stage before. In 2005 she surprised viewers by playing a mom to two grown women in the TV series Twins (2005), which was canceled after one season. She tried to resurrect her career with another attempt at a TV series, Viva Laughlin (2007), but it was canceled after just two episodes. Melanie didn&apos;t act again for the remainder of the decade, because, by self-admission, she couldn&apos;t obtain any worthwhile roles. In 2009, she was back in rehab after yet another relapse, emerging after a three-month stay. Professionally, she was faced with more disappointment in 2012 when This American Housewife (2012), a Lifetime series that Banderas produced for her to star in, never aired. She went back to the stage in 2012 and played Scott Caan&apos;s mother in a play that he wrote titled &quot;No Way Around but Through.&quot; She impressed Caan enough to recommend her to producers of his television show Hawaii Five-0 (2010). Since 2014, she started playing a recurring role as his mother on the show.Also in 2014, Melanie filed for divorce from Banderas citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; after nearly twenty years together. She never publicly discussed her reasons for the divorce, and she didn&apos;t promote her feature film Automata (2014), the final time that she acted with Banderas. It took a year for the divorce to be finalized, during which time, she and Banderas made one important appearance together at their daughter Stella&apos;s high school graduation. She also made another public appearance with another ex-husband, Don Johnson, on Il Saturday Night Live (1975) to support their daughter Dakota, who was the host for that week. Dakota was promoting her star-making turn in Cinquanta sfumature di grigio (2015), thus carrying on the family tradition of being a film actress. Melanie maintains close ties with her three children and her mother Tippi Hedren. She is involved in various charities, including raising funds for Tippi&apos;s Shambala preserve, a refuge for wild animals. Melanie also runs a non-profit organization for benefiting burned children. Melanie is single and her children are living on their own. So she has devoted most of her time seeking out acting roles.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Anna Lyda Elizabeth (Gray) and Eugene Ezra Hackman, who operated a newspaper printing press. He is of Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry, partly by way of Canada, where his mother was born. After several moves, his family settled in Danville, Illinois. Gene grew up in a broken home, which he left at the age of sixteen for a hitch with the US Marines. Moving to New York after being discharged, he worked in a number of menial jobs before studying journalism and television production on the G.I. Bill at the University of Illinois. Hackman would be over 30 years old when he finally decided to take his chance at acting by enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. Legend says that Hackman and friend Dustin Hoffman were voted &quot;least likely to succeed.&quot;Hackman next moved back to New York, where he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway. In 1964 he was cast as the young suitor in the Broadway play &quot;Any Wednesday.&quot; This role would lead to him being cast in the small role of Norman in Lilith - La dea dell&apos;amore (1964), starring Warren Beatty. When Beatty was casting for Gangster Story (1967), he cast Hackman as Buck Barrow, Clyde Barrow&apos;s brother. That role earned Hackman a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, an award for which he would again be nominated in Anello di sangue (1970). In 1972 he won the Oscar for his role as Detective Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle in Il braccio violento della legge (1971). At 40 years old Hackman was a Hollywood star whose work would rise to new heights with Bersaglio di notte (1975) and Stringi i denti e vai! (1975), or fall to new depths with L&apos;avventura del Poseidon (1972) and Eureka (1983). Hackman is a versatile actor who can play comedy (the blind man in Frankenstein Junior (1974)) or villainy (the evil Lex Luthor in Superman (1978)). He is the doctor who puts his work above people in Extreme Measures - Soluzioni estreme (1996) and the captain on the edge of nuclear destruction in Allarme rosso (1995). After initially turning down the role of Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood&apos;s Gli spietati (1992), Hackman finally accepted it, as its different slant on the western interested him. For his performance he won the Oscar and Golden Globe and decided that he wasn&apos;t tired of westerns after all. He has since appeared in Geronimo (1993), Wyatt Earp (1994), and Pronti a morire (1995).</rdfs:comment>

His parents, Sheila Gail (Scott) and Ronald Gene Harris, were lawyers and ran a restaurant.

While tagging along with his older brother of 3 years, Harris won the part of Toto in a school production of Il mago di Oz (1939).His parents moved the family to Albuquerque in 1988, the same year that Harris made his film debut in two movies: Amico venuto dallo spazio (1988) and Il grande cuore di Clara (1988), which starred Whoopi Goldberg. A year later, when Neil was 16, he landed the lead role in Steven Bochco&apos;s television series about a teen prodigy doctor at a local hospital, Doogie Howser, M.D. (1989), which launched Harris into teen-heartthrob status. The series lasted1989-1993 and earned him a People&apos;s Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Series (1990) and a Golden Globe Nomination (1990).

He continued in the musical, to rave reviews, until January 1998. He later reprised the role for six nights in his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in December 1998.In 1999, Harris returned to television in the short-lived sitcom Stark Raving Mad (1999), with Tony Shalhoub. He was also in the big-screen projects Sai che c&apos;Ã¨ di nuovo? (2000) and Undercover Brother (2002), and he can be heard as the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the newest animated Spider-Man (2003) series.

Hauer was born in Breukelen, a Dutch town and former municipality in the province of Utrecht.He was the son of Teunke (Mellema) and Arend Hauer, actors who operated an acting school. As his parents were often touring, he and his three sisters were raised by a nanny. A bit of a rebel during his childhood, he chafed at the rules and rigors of school and was often getting into mischief. His grandfather had been the captain of a schooner and at age fifteen, Hauer ran away to work on a freighter for a year. Like his great-grandfather, Hauer was color-blind, which prevented him from furthering his career as a sailor.Upon his return he attended night school and started working in the construction industry. When he again bombed at school, his parents enrolled him in drama classes. An amateur poet, he spent most of his time writing poetry and hanging out in Amsterdam coffee houses instead of studying. He was expelled for poor attendance and afterward spent a brief period in the Dutch navy.Deciding he didn&apos;t like military life, Hauer honed his acting skills trying to convince his superiors he was mentally unfit and was sent to a special home for psych patients. It was an unpleasant place, but Hauer remained there until he had convinced his ranking officers that the military really did not need him.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">For the past fourteen years, she has said that family has been the most important thing to her and she has set most of her time aside to be a &quot;present&quot; mother to her son. Movies, plays and television are chosen, for the most part, when they occur in town or on a school break. She has taken the current year to homeschool her son for his seventh grade. But it wasn&apos;t always this way. She was raised in New York City and wanted to be an actress from the time she was a child, graduating with acting honors from the High School of Performing Arts. She chose to opt out of studying acting in college and attended a small college in Europe, majoring in art history and literature, knowing that acting would take up a great deal of her life and that her college years would be her only real time to learn about something else. Upon graduation, she returned to New York City but a chance trip to Chicago inspired her to move there and become a part of its budding theatre community. It was in a production of &quot;Curse of The Starving Class&quot;, directed by Robert Falls and co-starring John Malkovich, that she was first seen by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company and, subsequently, asked to join their troupe. She did and learned what it really was to be an actress on her feet, performing in all kinds of roles in both comedy and drama. During this time, she won four Joseph Jefferson awards for best supporting actress.With a return move to New York, she received a Theatre World Award for &quot;best newcomer&quot; for her role in &quot;the Philanthropist&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club and appeared in &quot;Extremities&quot; with Susan Sarandon. This was followed by her appearance in the very successful Steppenwolf production in New York of &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot;. She then starred on Broadway opposite Kevin Kline and Raul Julia in &quot;Arms &amp; the Man&quot;, directed by John Malkovich, her husband at the time.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played &quot;Awful Knoffel&quot; in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed &quot;Awful Knoffel&quot; in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium (1996), Fox-TV&apos;s critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (X-Files (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for &quot;Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series&quot; and a People&apos;s Choice Award nomination for &quot;Favorite New TV Male Star&quot;.Henriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from TÃ¸nsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Three Plays of the Sea.&quot; One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet&apos;s Quel pomeriggio di un giorno da cani (1975), followed by parts in Lumet&apos;s Quinto potere (1976) and Il principe della cittÃ  (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg&apos;s Incontri ravvicinati del terzo tipo (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and FranÃ§ois Truffaut, La maledizione di Damien (1978) and in Philip Kaufman&apos;s Uomini veri (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.James Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, PiraÃ±a paura (1981), then used him again in Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens - Scontro finale (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Pronti a morire (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow&apos;s Il buio si avvicina (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998).In addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.</rdfs:comment>

His mother, Jean Wilson (nÃ©e Holm), was a nurse, and his father, Doctor James Harvey Cuthbert, was a psychiatrist. Young Holm was brought up in London. At the age of seven he was inspired by the seeing &apos;Les Miserables&apos; and became fond of acting. Holm studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1950 to the Royal Shakespeare Company.

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1936-05-17</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With an amazing cinematic career of more than five decades, Dennis Hopper was a multi-talented and unconventional actor/director, regarded by many as one of the true &quot;enfants terribles&quot; of Hollywood. Hopper was born on May 17, 1936 in Dodge City, Kansas, to Marjorie Mae (Davis) and James Millard Hopper. The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television series, including Medic (1954), Cheyenne (1955) and Sugarfoot (1957). His first film role was in Johnny Guitar (1954), which was quickly followed by roles in GioventÃ¹ bruciata (1955), Il gigante (1956) and Sfida all&apos;O.K. Corral (1957). Hopper actually became good friends with James Dean and was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash on September 30, 1955.Hopper portrayed a young NapolÃ©on Bonaparte (!) in the star-spangled L&apos;inferno ci accusa (1957) and regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as Il Grinta (1969) and Impiccalo piÃ¹ in alto (1968). However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor Peter Fonda and writer Terry Southern, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled Easy Rider (1969), starring Fonda, Hopper and a young Jack Nicholson. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper&apos;s next directorial effort, Fuga da Hollywood (1971), was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen in Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for Snack bar blues (1980).With these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in Rusty il selvaggio (1983), co-starred in the tepid spy thriller Osterman Weekend (1983), played a groovy school teacher in Ritorno alla quarta dimensione (1985), was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in I ragazzi del fiume (1986) and, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic David Lynch film Velluto blu (1986). Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; in the animated series of &quot;Rabbit Ears&quot; children&apos;s films based upon the works of Hans Christian Andersen!Hopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film Colors - colori di guerra (1988), which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in Super Mario Bros. (1993), got on the wrong side of gangster Christopher Walken in Una vita al massimo (1993), led police officer Keanu Reeves and bus passenger Sandra Bullock on a deadly ride in Speed (1994) and challenged gill-man Kevin Costner for world supremacy in Waterworld (1995). The enigmatic Hopper has continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in The Night We Called It a Day (2003), The Keeper (2004) and La terra dei morti viventi (2005).As well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and has one of the most extensive collections in the United States. Dennis Hopper died of prostate cancer on May 29, 2010, less than two weeks after his 74th birthday.</rdfs:comment>

Hunter went on to get roles in a number of Henley&apos;s southern gothic plays, including Crimes of the Heart and The Miss Firecracker Contest. In 1982 the actress went to Los Angeles. She landed her first starring role in the movies in the Coen brothers&apos; Arizona Junior (1987), a part that is said to have been written with her in mind. She gained stardom in 1987 when she played the driven TV news producer Jane Craig in James L. Brooks&apos; Dentro la notizia (1987). In 1993 she earned an Academy Award and worldwide acclaim with her performance as a mute bride to a New Zealand planter in Lezioni di piano (1993).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One of stage, screen and TV&apos;s finest transatlantic talents, slight, gravel-voiced, pasty-looking John Vincent Hurt was born on January 22, 1940, in Shirebrook, a coal mining village, in Derbyshire, England. The youngest child of Phyllis (Massey), an engineer and one-time actress, and Reverend Arnould Herbert Hurt, an Anglican clergyman and mathematician, his quiet shyness betrayed an early passion for acting. First enrolled at the Grimsby Art School and St. Martin&apos;s School of Art, his focus invariably turned from painting to acting.Accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1960, John made his stage debut in &quot;Infanticide in the House of Fred Ginger&quot; followed by &quot;The Dwarfs.&quot; Elsewhere, he continued to build upon his 60&apos;s theatrical career with theatre roles in &quot;Chips with Everything&quot; at the Vaudeville; the title role in &quot;Hamp&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival; &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot; at Wyndham&apos;s; and &quot;Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs&quot; at the Garrick. His movie debut occurred that same year with a supporting role in the &quot;angry young man&quot; British drama The Wild and the Willing (1962), followed by small roles in Appuntamento in Riviera (1962), Un uomo per tutte le stagioni (1966) and Il marinaio del Gibilterra (1967).A somber, freckled, ravaged-looking gent, Hurt found his more compelling early work in offbeat theatrical characterizations with notable roles as Malcolm in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1967), Octavius in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1969),&quot; Peter in &quot;Ride a Cock Horse (1972), Mike in &apos;&quot;The Caretaker&quot; (1972), and Ben in &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; (1973). At the same time he gained more prominence in a spray of film and support roles such as a junior officer in Prima che venga l&apos;inverno (1968); the title highwayman in La forca puÃ² attendere (1969); a morose little brother in Alla ricerca di Gregory (1969); a dim, murderous truck driver in L&apos;assassino di Rillington Place n. 10 (1971); a skirt-chasing, penguin-studying biologist in Mr. Forbush and the Penguins (1971); the unappetizing son of a baron in Il pifferaio di Hamelin (1972); and a repeat of his title stage role as Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1974).Hurt shot to international stardom, however, on TV where he was allowed to display his true, fearless range. He reaped widespread acclaim for his embodiment of the tormented gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the landmark television play Funzionario nudo (1975), adapted from Crisp&apos;s autobiography. Hurt&apos;s bold, unabashed approach on the flamboyant and controversial gent who dared to be different was rewarded with the BAFTA (British TV Award). This triumph led to the equally fascinating success as the cruel and crazed Roman emperor Caligula in the epic television masterpiece Claudius (1976), followed by another compelling interpretation as murderous student Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1979).A resurgence occurred on film as a result. Among other unsurpassed portraits on his unique pallet, the chameleon in him displayed a polar side as the gentle, pathetically disfigured title role in The Elephant Man (1980), and as a tortured Turkish prison inmate who befriends Brad Davis in the intense drama Fuga di mezzanotte (1978) earning Oscar nominations for both. Mainstream box-office films were offered as well as art films. He made the most of his role as a crew member whose body becomes host to an unearthly predator in Alien (1979). With this new rush of fame came a few misguided ventures as well that were generally unworthy of his talent. Such brilliant work as his steeple chase jockey in Champions (1984) or kidnapper in Vendetta (1984) was occasionally offset by such drivel as the comedy misfire Lui Ã¨ mio (1982) with Ryan O&apos;Neal in which Hurt looked enervated and embarrassed. For the most part, the craggy-faced actor continued to draw extraordinary notices. Tops on the list includes his prurient governmental gadfly who triggers the Christine Keeler political sex scandal in the aptly-titled Scandal - Il caso Profumo (1989); the cultivated gay writer aroused and obsessed with struggling &quot;pretty-boy&quot; actor Jason Priestley in Amore e morte a Long Island (1997); and the Catholic priest embroiled in the Rwanda atrocities in Shooting Dogs (2005).Latter parts included the recurring role of the benign wand-maker Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale (2001) and Harry Potter e i Doni della Morte - Parte 1 (2010), and the voice of The Dragon in Merlin (2008). Among Hurt&apos;s final film appearances were as a terminally ill screenwriter in That Good Night (2017) and a lesser role in the mystery thriller Damascus Cover (2017). Hurt&apos;s voice was also tapped into animated features and documentaries, often serving as narrator. He also returned to the theatre performing in such shows as &quot;The Seagull,&quot; &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1994), &quot;Afterplay&quot; (2002) and &quot;Krapp&apos;s Last Tape,&quot; the latter for which he received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.&quot;A recovered alcoholic who married four times, Hurt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen in 2004, and Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in 2015. That same year (2015) he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In July of 2016, he was forced to bow out of the father role of Billy Rice in a then-upcoming London stage production of &quot;The Entertainer&quot; opposite Kenneth Branagh due to ill health that he described as an &quot;intestinal ailment.&quot; Hurt died several months later at his home in Cromer, Norfolk, England on January 15, 2017, three days after his 77th birthday.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Michael Ironside has made a strong and indelible impression with his often incredibly intense and explosive portrayals of fearsome villains throughout the years. He was born as Frederick Reginald Ironside on February 12, 1950 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ironside was a successful arm wrestler in his teenage years. His initial ambition was to be a writer. At age fifteen, Michael wrote a play called &quot;The Shelter&quot; that won first prize in a Canada-wide university contest; He used the prize money to mount a production of this play. Ironside attended the Ontario College of Art, took acting lessons from Janine Manatis, and studied for three years at the Canadian National Film Board. Ironside worked in construction as a roofer prior to embarking on an acting career.Ironside first began acting in movies in the late 1970s. He received plenty of recognition with his frightening turn as deadly and powerful psychic Darryl Revok in David Cronenberg&apos;s Scanners (1981). He was likewise very chilling as vicious misogynistic psychopath Colt Hawker in the underrated Delitto al Central Hospital (1982). Other memorable film roles include weary Detective Roersch in the sadly forgotten thriller Cross Country (1983), the crazed Overdog in the immensely enjoyable Il cacciatore dello spazio (1983), the hard-nosed Jester in the blockbuster smash Top Gun (1986), ramrod Major Paul Hackett in Ricercati: ufficialmente morti (1987), loner Vietnam veteran &quot;Ben&quot; in Senza respiro (1987), the ferocious Lem Johnson in Alterazione genetica (1988), and lethal immortal General Katana in Highlander II - Il ritorno (1991).Moreover, Ironside has appeared in two highly entertaining science fiction features for Paul Verhoeven: At his savage best as the evil Richter in Atto di forza (1990) and typically excellent as the rugged Lieutenant Jean Rasczak in Starship Troopers - Fanteria dello spazio (1997). Ironside showed a more tender and thoughtful side with his lovely and touching performance as a hardened convict who befriends a disabled man in the poignant indie drama gem Chain Dance - Sotto massima sicurezza (1991); he also co-wrote the script and served as an executive producer for this beautiful sleeper. Michael was terrific as tough mercenary Ham Tyler on the epic miniseries Visitors (1984), its follow up V: The Final Battle (1984), and subsequent short-lived spin-off series.Ironside also had a recurring role on the television series SeaQuest (1993). Among the television series he has done guest spots on are A-Team (1983), Hill Street giorno e notte (1981), Mike Hammer (1984), I viaggiatori delle tenebre (1983), I racconti della cripta (1989), Le avventure di Superman (1996), Walker Texas Ranger (1993), Oltre i limiti (1995), E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), Smallville (2001), E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), Desperate Housewives - I segreti di Wisteria Lane (2004), Justice League (2001) and Masters of Horror (2005). More recently, Ironside garnered a slew of plaudits and a Gemini Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of shrewd biker gang leader Bob Durelle in the acclaimed Canadian miniseries The Last Chapter II: The War Continues (2003).In addition to his substantial film and television work, Ironside has also lent his distinctive deep voice to TV commercials and video games.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Since the demise of the legendary John Holmes in March 1988, the short, mustachioed, heavyset Ron Jeremy has assumed the mantle as the number one U.S. male star of adult cinema. However, don&apos;t confuse Ron with the similar looking mustachioed 1970/&apos;80s adult film star, Harry Reems, who has long since retired from the adult film industry. Portly Ron is not blessed with film star looks and a chiseled six-pack (a decidedly unchiseled 12- or 18-pack would be more like it) - his appeal and talents lie in other areas (which happen to be in his long &apos;member&apos; measuring nearly 10 inches, erect!) and his &quot;regular guy&quot; appearance and amazing endurance in front of the camera have undoubtedly contributed to his phenomenal success in an industry notorious for dumping those men who can&apos;t perform on cue.He&apos;s also one of the very few adult film stars to make the jump into mainstream cinema, with minor appearances in movies such as Trappola criminale (2000), Detroit Rock City (1999) and The Boondock Saints - Giustizia finale (1999). He was born Ron Jeremy Hyatt on March 12, 1953, in New York City and graduated from Cardozo High School (Queens, NY) in 1971, attained a masters degree from Queens College and then commenced special educational teaching in the New York City area. In 1978, a girlfriend sent his photo off to &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine for appearance in its &quot;Boy Next Door&quot; pages. It was an understatement to say that Ron was deluged with female fan mail, and letters of interest from adult filmmakers!Beginning in 1979, he has appeared in well over 800 adult feature films including Inside Seka (1980), Debbie Does Dallas Part II (1981), Terms of Endowment (1986) Lust of Blackula (1987), 21 Hump Street (1988) and Natural Born Thrillers (1994). At 50+ years of age, the charismatic and often comedic Ron Jeremy is still appearing in front of the camera in adult films and he&apos;s definitely attained iconic status in the adult entertainment industry and beyond.</rdfs:comment>

        <ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1953-09-03</ActorOntology:hasPlaceOfBirth>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a self-taught director who was very quickly interested by cinema, with a predilection for a fantastic cinema where form is as important as the subject. Thus he started directing TV commercials and video clips (such as Julien Clerc in 1984). At the same time he met designer/drawer Marc Caro with whom he made two short animation movies: L&apos;Ã©vasion (1978) and Le manÃ¨ge (1981), the latter winning a CÃ©sar for the best short movie. After these two successful movies Jeunet and Caro spent more than one year together by making every detail (scenario, costumes, production design) of their third short movie: Le bunker de la derniÃ¨re rafale (1981). This movie combined sci-fi and heroic-fantasy in a visually delirious story of the rising paranoia among soldiers trapped underground. With that movie they garnered several festival prizes in France. (This movie also marked their first collaboration with Gilles Adrien who later wrote the story of their two feature movies with them). After that Jeunet directed two other short movies without the help of Caro: Pas de repos pour Billy Brakko (1984), then Foutaises (1989) with Dominique Pinon who became another regular collaborator of Jeunet. All Jeunet&apos;s short movies won a lot of awards in France but also overseas and he won a second CÃ©sar with Foutaises (1989).In 1991, Jeunet and Caro took their first steps in a feature movie: Delicatessen (1991). It was such a success that it won 4 CÃ©sars including the awards for the best new director(s) and the best scenario. For this movie Jeunet and Caro divided responsibilities with the former guiding the actors and the latter coordinating the artistic elements. And Jeunet showed again his liking to have Dominique Pinon, of course, but also Rufus, Jean-Claude Dreyfus and Ticky Holgado who appeared again in Jeunet&apos;s next movies, or Maurice Lamy who already had a little role in Foutaises (1989). The success of Delicatessen (1991) even surprised Jeunet and Caro themselves but they took advantage of that in order to finally make their almost 10 year-old project! This project took more than 4 more years to be carried out but the movie turned out enormous: La cittÃ  perduta (1995) was a black tale and was so innovative at this period that they needed to create new software for the special effects (mostly made by Pitof). Jeunet and Caro kept the same responsibilities as in Delicatessen (1991) and the movie also combined different international skills: US actor Ron Perlman, Chilean-born actor Daniel Emilfork, Iranian cinematographer Darius Khondji (who was already in the crew of Delicatessen (1991)), Americo-Italian composer Angelo Badalamenti and French fashion-designer Jean-Paul Gaultier for the costumes. While the film was supposed to be suitable for children, some considered it &quot;dark&quot;, to which Jeunet and Caro replied that it was no more &quot;dark&quot; than Pinocchio (1940) or Bambi (1942).But these critics didn&apos;t stop the movie from being successful and when the movie gained them further attention, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood called them. Thus in 1997, Jeunet left France to make a temporary career in the USA for the fourth installment of the &apos;Alien&apos; series: Alien - La clonazione (1997). Marc Caro followed him just as a design supervisor but Jeunet brought with him a little army&apos; of his usual collaborators (mostly French): actors Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman, but also Pitof, Darius Khondji or editor HervÃ© Schneid, and for the first time Alain Carsoux who was responsible of the special effects of Jeunet&apos;s next film. In 2000, after two collaborations with Caro and one in the US, Jeunet came back to France in order to make a more personal movie, even if Guillaume Laurant wrote the story with him. Thus he used a lot of different details he wrote everywhere during his life (and also recycled things he&apos;d already done, e.g. in Foutaises (1989)) and shot his story mostly in the Parisian suburb of Montmartre where he lives. Then the result was Il favoloso mondo di AmÃ©lie (2001) starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz. With this movie Jeunet made the biggest worldwide success of French cinema history. A real magical potion, which won innumerable awards in the whole world including 4 CÃ©sars (therefore Jeunet won his fifth and sixth CÃ©sars!).Jeunet eventually decided to adapt SÃ©bastien Japrisot&apos;s book Una lunga domenica di passioni (2004) for which he called Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon again, but also many other famous French actors and Jodie Foster. It had one of the most important budgets in French film history and eventually had a good international success and many nominations and awards.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series Miami Vice (1984), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer Michael Mann, paired Johnson with the equally cool Philip Michael Thomas as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named &quot;St. Vitus&apos; Dance&quot; with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world&apos;s favorite cop. For his work on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son Eva Lea (Wilson), a beautician, and Freddie Wayne Johnson, a farmer. As a kid, he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic Apocalypse 2024 - Un ragazzo, un cane, due inseparabili amici (1975).Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in a praised TV-movie adaption of the William Faulkner novel La lunga estate calda (1985) and the feature Ancora insieme (1988) with Susan Sarandon. After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like Dead bang - A colpo sicuro (1989), The Hot Spot - Il posto caldo (1990) and Harley Davidson e Marlboro Man (1991) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like John Frankenheimer, Sidney Lumet and Dennis Hopper.After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show Nash Bridges (1996). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred Cheech Marin and Jodi Lyn O&apos;Keefe. Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD&apos;s Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continued to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama Just Legal (2005), which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and traveled to Europe to make the Norwegian screwball comedy Lange flate ballÃ¦r II (2008) and the Italian films Bastardi (2008) and Torno a vivere da solo (2008). As a supporting actor, he&apos;s been seen in mainstream films such as Machete (2010), Django Unchained (2012) and Cena con delitto - Knives Out (2019).Johnson had two pre-fame marriages that were annulled within a matter of days. In the early 1970s, he lived with rock groupie Pamela Des Barres. In 1972, Tippi Hedren, his co-star in The Harrad Experiment (1973), allowed him to date her daughter Melanie Griffith despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. From 1981 to 1985, he lived with actress Patti D&apos;Arbanville and they had one son together. After short-lived liaisons with Cybill Shepherd, Barbra Streisand and a barely legal Uma Thurman, he remarried Griffith in 1989. The couple divorced again in 1996, after she left him for Antonio Banderas. Johnson was engaged to &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; co-star O&apos;Keefe, but broke it off before they made it to the altar. Since 1999 he&apos;s been married to former debutante Kelley Phleger, with whom he has three children.</rdfs:comment>

At an early age, he started to take dramatic lessons to calm himself down. It appeared to work as he has since starred in many films over a 40-year period, beginning with the Stanley Kubrick classic Il dottor Stranamore - Ovvero: come ho imparato a non preoccuparmi e ad amare la bomba (1964). For several movie fans, he is probably best known for his role as Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy (due to his contribution for the voice of the role, as the man in the Darth Vader suit was David Prowse, whose voice was dubbed because of his British West Country accent). In his brilliant course of memorable performances, among others, he has also appeared on the animated series I Simpson (1989) three times and played Mufasa both in The Lion King (1994) and Il Re Leone (2019), while he returned too as the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars: Episodio III - La vendetta dei Sith (2005) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Raul Julia was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Olga Arcelay, a mezzo-soprano singer, and RaÃºl JuliÃ¡, an electrical engineer. He graduated from Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola High School in San Juan. Here he studied the rigorous classical curriculum of the Jesuits and was always active in student dramatics. Julia was discovered while performing in a nightclub in San Juan by actor Orson Bean who inspired him to move to the mainland to pursue other projects. Julia moved to Manhattan, New York City in 1964 and quickly found work by acting in small and supporting roles in off-Broadway shows. In 1966, Julia began appearing in Shakespearean roles, creating a deliciously conniving Edmund in &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1973 and a smoldering Othello in 1979. Julia also made his mark on the musical stage playing one of the &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; during its run in 1971, and a chilling role of Mack the Knife in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; in 1976 and as a Felliniesque film director in &quot;Nine&quot; in 1982. The stage successes led to his movie works where he is better known.One of his best movie roles is a passionate political prisoner in Il bacio della donna ragno (1985). Julia also appeared as dramatic heroes and memorable villains in a number of films and made-for-TV-movies. His later roles included the crazy macabre Gomez Addams in two Addams Family movies. With his health declining from 1993 onward after he underwent a surgical operation for stomach cancer, Julia kept on acting, where he traveled to Mexico during the winter of 1993-1994 to play the Brazilian Amazon forest activist Chico Mendes in Il fuoco della resistenza - La vera storia di Chico Mendes (1994), for which he posthumously won a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. His last theatrical movie was filmed shortly after Il fuoco della resistenza - La vera storia di Chico Mendes (1994) when he traveled to Australia to shoot all of his scenes for Street Fighter - Sfida finale (1994), based on the popular video game where he played the villainous General M. Bison. His last role was a supporting part in another made-for-TV movie titled Down Came a Blackbird (1995).On October 16, 1994, the weakened and gaunt Raul Julia suffered a stroke in New York City where he fell into a coma a few days later and was put on life support. He was transferred to a hospice in nearby Manhasset, Long Island where his weakened body finally gave up the struggle on October 24, at age 54. His body was flown back to Puerto Rico for burial where thousands turned out for his state funeral to remember him. Two honoring ceremonies were held at Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola High School, and at the Headquarters of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture prior to his burial.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Along with fellow actors Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price, Boris Karloff is recognized as one of the true icons of horror cinema, and the actor most closely identified with the general public&apos;s perception of the &quot;monster&quot; from the classic Mary Shelley book, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. William Henry Pratt was born on November 23, 1887, in Camberwell, London, England, the son of Edward John Pratt Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Customs Salt and Opium, Northern Division, Indian Salt Revenue Service, and his third wife, Eliza Sarah Millard.He was educated at London University in anticipation that he would pursue a diplomatic career; however, he emigrated to Canada in 1909 and joined a touring company based out of Ontario and adopted the stage name of &quot;Boris Karloff.&quot; He toured back and forth across the USA for over ten years in a variety of low-budget theater shows and eventually ended up in Hollywood, reportedly with very little money to his name. Needing cash to support himself, Karloff secured occasional acting work in the fledgling silent film industry in such pictures as The Deadlier Sex (1920), Omar the Tentmaker (1922), Dynamite Dan (1924) and Tarzan and the Golden Lion (1927), in addition to a handful of serials (the majority of which sadly haven&apos;t survived). Karloff supplemented his meager film income by working as a truck driver in Los Angeles, which allowed him enough time off to continue to pursue acting roles.His big break came in 1931 when he was cast as &quot;the monster&quot; in the Universal production of Frankenstein (1931), directed by James Whale, one of the studio&apos;s few remaining auteur directors. The aura of mystery surrounding Karloff was highlighted in the opening credits, as he was listed as simply &quot;?&quot;. The film was a commercial and critical success for Universal, and Karloff was instantly established as a hot property in Hollywood. He quickly appeared in several other sinister roles, including Scarface - Lo sfregiato (1932) (filmed before Frankenstein (1931)), the black-humored The Old Dark House (1932), as the namesake Oriental villain of the Sax Rohmer novels in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), as undead Im-Ho-Tep in La mummia (1932) and the misguided Prof. Morlant in The Ghoul (1933). He thoroughly enjoyed his role as a religious fanatic in John Ford&apos;s La pattuglia sperduta (1934), although contemporary critics described it as a textbook example of overacting.He donned the signature make-up, neck bolts and asphalt spreader&apos;s boots again to play Frankenstein&apos;s monster in the sensational La moglie di Frankenstein (1935) and the less thrilling Il figlio di Frankenstein (1939). Karloff, on loan to Fox, appeared in one of the best of the Warner Oland Chan entries, Il pugnale scomparso (1936), before beginning his own short-lived Mr. Wong detective series. He was a wrongly condemned doctor in Devil&apos;s Island (1939), shaven-headed executioner &quot;Mord the Merciless&quot; in L&apos;usurpatore (1939), another misguided scientist in The Ape (1940), a crazed scientist surrounded by monsters, vampires and werewolves in Al di lÃ  del mistero (1944), a murderous cabman in La jena: L&apos;uomo di mezzanotte (1945) and a Greek general fighting vampirism in the Val Lewton thriller Il vampiro dell&apos;isola (1945).While Karloff continued appearing in a plethora of films, many of them were not up to the standards of his previous efforts, including appearances in two of the hokey Bud Abbott and Lou Costello monster movies (he had appeared with them in an earlier superior effort, Gianni e Pinotto e l&apos;assassino misterioso (1949), which theater owners often added his name to the marquee), the low point of the Universal-International horror movie cycle. During the 1950s he was a regular guest on many high-profile TV shows including Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle (1948), Tales of Tomorrow (1951), The Veil (1958), The Donald O&apos;Connor Show (1954), The Red Skelton Show (1951) and The Dinah Shore Chevy Show (1956), to name but a few, and he appeared in a mixed bag of films including Sabaka il demone del fuoco (1954) and L&apos;isola stregata degli zombies (1957). On Broadway he appeared as the murderous Brewster brother in the hit, &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (his role, or the absence of him in it, was amusingly parodied in the film version) and a decade later he enjoyed a long run in &quot;Peter Pan,&quot; perfectly cast as &quot;Captain Hook.&quot;His career experienced something of a revival in the 1960s thanks to hosting the TV anthology series Thriller (1960) and indie director Roger Corman, with Karloff contributing wonderful performances in I maghi del terrore (1963), La vergine di cera (1963), the ultra-eerie I tre volti della paura (1963) and the H.P. Lovecraft-inspired La morte dall&apos;occhio di cristallo (1965). Karloff&apos;s last great role was as an aging horror movie star confronting a modern-day sniper in the Peter Bogdanovich film Bersagli (1968). In 1970, he played the blind sculptor Franz Badulescu in El coleccionista de cadÃ¡veres (1970), written, produced, and directed by Edward Mann, who had also come to the art of film from stage theater. His TV career was capped off by achieving Christmas immortality as the narrator of Chuck Jones&apos;s perennial animated favorite, Come il Grinch rubÃ² il Natale (1966). Three low-budget Mexican-produced horror films starring an ailing Karloff were released in the two years after his death; however, they do no justice to this actor. In retrospect, he never took himself too seriously as an actor and had a tendency to downplay his acting accomplishments. Renowned as a refined, kind and warm-hearted gentleman, with a sincere affection for children and their welfare, Karloff passed away on February 2, 1969 from emphysema. Respectful of his Indian roots and in true Hindu fashion, he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium, Godalming, Surrey, England, where he is commemorated by a plaque in Plot 2 of the Garden of Remembrance.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Diane Keaton was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, California, to Dorothy Deanne (Keaton), an amateur photographer, and John Newton Ignatius &quot;Jack&quot; Hall, a civil engineer and real estate broker. She studied Drama at Santa Ana College, before dropping out in favor of the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. After appearing in summer stock for several months, she got her first major stage role in the Broadway rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;. As understudy to the lead, she gained attention by not removing any of her clothing. In 1968, Woody Allen cast her in his Broadway play &quot;Play It Again, Sam,&quot; which had a successful run. It was during this time that she became involved with Allen and appeared in a number of his films. The first one was Provaci ancora, Sam (1972), the screen adaptation of the stage play. That same year Francis Ford Coppola cast her as Kay in the Oscar-winning Il padrino (1972), and she was on her way to stardom. She reprized that role in the film&apos;s first sequel, Il padrino - Parte II (1974). She then appeared with Allen again in Il dormiglione (1973) and Amore e guerra (1975).In 1977, she broke away from her comedy image to appear in the chilling In cerca di Mr. Goodbar (1977), which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was the same year that she appeared in what many regard as her best performance, in the title role of Io e Annie (1977), which Allen wrote specifically for her (her real last name is Hall, and her nickname is Annie), and what an impact she made. She won the Oscar and the British Award for Best Actress, and Allen won the Directors Award from the DGA. She started a fashion trend with her unisex clothes and was the poster girl for a lot of young males. Her mannerisms and awkward speech became almost a national craze. The question being asked, though, was, &quot;Is she just a lightweight playing herself, or is there more depth to her personality?&quot; For whatever reason, she appeared in but one film a year for the next two years and those films were by Allen. When they broke up she was next involved with Warren Beatty and appeared in his film Reds (1981), as the bohemian female journalist Louise Bryant. For her performance, she received nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe. For the rest of the 1980s she appeared infrequently in films but won nominations in three of them. Attempting to break the typecasting she had fallen into, she took on the role of a confused, somewhat naive woman who becomes involved with Middle Eastern terrorists in La tamburina (1984). To offset her lack of movie work, Diane began directing. She directed the documentary Heaven (1987), as well as some music videos. For television she directed an episode of the popular, but strange, I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990).In the 1990s, she began to get more mature roles, though she reprized the role of Kay Corleone in the third &quot;Godfather&quot; epic, Il padrino - Parte III (1990). She appeared as the wife of Steve Martin in the hit Il padre della sposa (1991) and again in Il padre della sposa 2 (1995). In 1993 she once again teamed with Woody Allen in Misterioso omicidio a Manhattan (1993), which was well received. In 1995 she received high marks for Eroi di tutti i giorni (1995), her first major feature as a director.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Quirky, inventive and handsome American actor Michael Keaton first achieved major fame with his door-busting performance as fast-talking ideas man Bill Blazejowski, alongside a nerdish morgue attendant (Henry Winkler), in Night Shift - Turno di notte (1982). He played further comedic roles in Mister mamma (1983), Pericolosamente Johnny (1984), and Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988), earned further acclaim for his dramatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton&apos;s Batman (1989) and Batman - Il ritorno (1992), and since then, has moved easily between film genres, ranging from drama and romantic comedy to thriller and action.Keaton was born Michael John Douglas on September 5, 1951 in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, to Leona Elizabeth (Loftus), a homemaker, and George A. Douglas, a civil engineer and surveyor. He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of Mister Rogers&apos; Neighborhood (1968).He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift - Turno di notte (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mister mamma (1983), Pericolosamente Johnny (1984) , Gung Ho - Arrivano i giapponesi (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988), and 4 pazzi in libertÃ  (1989).Keaton&apos;s career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Batman (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, &quot;The Joker&quot;. Keaton&apos;s dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Batman (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year.Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Uno sconosciuto alla porta (1990), as a hard-working cop in La giustizia di un uomo (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Batman - Il ritorno (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Molto rumore per nulla (1993), the drama My Life - Questa mia vita (1993), another Ron Howard comedy Cronisti d&apos;assalto (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Mi sdoppio in quattro (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Soluzione estrema (1998).In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Live from Baghdad (2002), Una teenager alla Casa Bianca (2004), and Herbie - Il super maggiolino (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Cars - Motori ruggenti (2006), Toy Story 3 - La grande fuga (2010), and Minions (2015).He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in I poliziotti di riserva (2010), RoboCop (2014) and Need for Speed (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Birdman o (L&apos;imprevedibile virtÃ¹ dell&apos;ignoranza) (2014), a film by 21 grammi (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton&apos;s critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics&apos; Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor.In 2015, he played a journalist in Il caso Spotlight (2015), which, like Birdman, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2016, he starred as Ray Kroc, the developer of McDonald&apos;s, in the drama The Founder (2016).He is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Walter Koenig began his acting career in 1962 as an uncredited, non-speaking Sentry in the TV series Combat! (1962), and in the following few years had bit roles in several television shows, until he landed the role that would catapult his career in ways he could never have imagined, as Ensign Pavel Chekov in Star Trek&apos;s Original Series (Star Trek (1966)). He went on to reprise that role in all 7 of the original Star Trek movies (The 7th movie, Generazioni (1994) was mostly ST: The Next Generation, but had the original series section at the beginning, and Kirk at the end), as well as voicing the same character in several of the video games. He has continued to reprise that character in several different Star Trek video&apos;s, and TV series, rising in rank to Lieutenant, Commander, Captain and Admiral through the years (his most recent being Admiral Chekov in the pilot of Star Trek: Renegades (2015), which never launched, but that evolved to Renegades (2017), a 2 part, crowd-funded, fan-made mini series that also stars fellow Original Series star Nichelle Nichols (as a character NOT named &apos;Uhura&apos;). Since it was Fan-Made (and to avoid violating studio rights) they couldn&apos;t use the Star Trek Character&apos;s names, like Uhura or Chekov, so they simply called him &apos;The Admiral&apos;. (however the uniforms and technology are remarkably Star Trek like.) He also had a recurring role of the quintessential scoundrel Bester on the television series Babylon 5 (1993). He has been the &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; in twelve episodes and, at the end of the third season, the production company applied for an Emmy nomination on his behalf. He once again played Bester in the spin-off series Crusade (1999). In between filming the 4th and 5th Star Trek films he took his first leading role in the video feature, Moontrap - Destinazione Terra (1989). In an interactive state-of-the-art video game from Digital Pictures called Maximum Surge (1996), Koenig played as Drexel, another scoundrel.Walter completed worked in the low budget feature film Drawing Down the Moon (1997) from Chaos Productions. And has star billing as a German psychologist in the martial arts picture, Giustizia bionda (1996). A one character piece that Koenig wrote and performed entitled &quot;You&apos;re Never Alone when You&apos;re a Schizophrenic&quot; was a finalist in the 1996 New York Film Festival awards. Koenig filmed a guest appearance as himself on the CBS situation comedy Almost Perfect (1995), did sketch comedy on the Comedy Central series &quot;Viva Variety&quot; (1996) and performed on an ESPN sports commercial that aired in the spring of 1998. Walter also hosted a cult movie marathon for Comedy Central. It played once a week for the course of a month.Koenig&apos;s autobiography, &quot;Warped Factors - A Neurotic&apos;s Guide to the Universe&quot; was released through Taylor Publishing on April 1, 1998. The audio tape reading of the book by the author has been released through Dove Video in January 1999. Koenig performed as the Shadow Guy in an episode of Un detective in corsia (1993) and went to New York to perform in a new radio broadcast version of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; in tribute to both H.G. Wells and Orson Welles. From &quot;The Girls of Summer&quot; to &quot;The Boys in Autumn&quot;, Koenig&apos;s stage career spans thirty years and includes stops in New York with &quot;A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream&quot; (Quince) and &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; (Oldest Son). In Chicago, he guested in &quot;Make a Million&quot; (Johnny) opposite Jackie Coogan and on the road -- from Arizon to Philadelphia -- Mark Lenard (Sarek: Spock&apos;s father) and he performed in the short plays &quot;Box and Cox&quot; (Box) and &quot;Actors&quot; (Dave). They also toured in a two character play, &quot;The Boys in Autumn&quot;, the comedy-drama about the reunion of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn forty years later.By himself, Koenig also starred as Larry the Liquidator in &quot;Other People&apos;s Money&quot; in Reno, Nevada. His Los Angeles productions include &quot;Steambath&quot; (God), &quot;The White House Murder Case&quot; (Captain Weems), &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (Danny), &quot;La Ronde&quot; (Gentleman), &quot;The Typist and the Tiger&quot; (Paul), and &quot;The Deputy&quot; (Jacobson) among almost two dozen others (&quot;Blood Wedding&quot;, &quot;The Collection&quot;, et al.). Directorial credits include &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; for Company of Angles, &quot;Beckett&quot; for Theatre 40, &quot;America Hurrah!&quot; at the Oxford Theater, &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; at the Rita Hayworth Theatre, &quot;Matrix&quot; at the Gascon Theatre Institute, and &quot;Three by Ten&quot; at Actor&apos;s Alley. Walter has performed in the television movies Antony and Cleopatra (1984) (Pompey) opposite Timothy Dalton and Lynn Redgrave as well as the MOW&apos;s Addio vecchia Ann (1971) and The Questor Tapes (1974).Walter has written for the television series Il principe delle stelle (1982), What Really Happened to the Class of &apos;65? (1977), In casa Lawrence (1976), Land of the Lost (1974), and the animated Star Trek (1973) series. This actor-writer has seen publication with the non-fiction &quot;Chekov&apos;s Enterprise&quot; and the satiric fantasy novel &quot;Buck Alice and the Actor-Robot&quot;. He also created the three issues of the comic book story &quot;Raver&quot; published by Malibu Comics. Koenig has taught classes in acting and directing privately at UCLA, The Sherwood Oaks Experimental Film College and at the California School of Professional Psychology. Most recently, he has been an instructor at the Actor&apos;s Alley Repertory Company in Los Angeles, California.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Elias Koteas was born on March 11, 1961, in Montreal, Canada. Both his parents are of Greek descent. Elias attended Vanier College in Montreal before leaving to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in 1981, of which he is a graduate. He also attended the Actors Studio in New York City, where he studied acting under Ellen Burstyn and Peter Masterson. His film debut was in Un magico Natale (1985). He has also appeared on stage in &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; &quot;Death of a Salesman,&quot; &quot;Bent&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard.&quot; In 1989 he was nominated for a Genie (Canada&apos;s Academy Award) for best actor in Malarek (1988), a true story in which he plays a troubled street-kid-turned reporter for a Canadian newspaper. A somewhat of a breakthrough role for Elias happened in 1990, when he got the role of vigilante Casey Jones in Tartarughe Ninja alla riscossa (1990) and its sequels. He is one of Canada&apos;s most popular actors and frequently appears in films by Canadian directors Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg. It was Cronenberg&apos;s controversial movie Crash (1996) that had Cannes all abuzz in 1996. Elias played Vaughan, a self-appointed &quot;mad scientist&quot; with an unusual fetish--sexual delight in car crashes! The past two years have been busy ones for Koteas, adding six more roles to his resume. As Capt. James Staros, the commanding officer of Charlie Company in La sottile linea rossa (1998), he brought sensitivity and compassion to his portrayal of a man who cared about the safety of his men--even at the risk of his own career. In 2000 he appeared in Lost Souls - La profezia (2000), a thriller starring Winona Ryder, and starred on Broadway with Josh Brolin in the Sam Shepard play &quot;True West.&quot;</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Alice Maud Krige was born on June 28, 1954 in Upington, South Africa where her father, Dr. Louis Krige, worked as a young physician. The Kriges later moved to Port Elizabeth where Alice grew up in what she describes as a &quot;very happy family&quot;, a family that also included two brothers (both of whom became physicians) and her mother, Pat, a clinical psychologist. Interestingly, Alice also grew up without television, something which the actress calls a &quot;huge black hole in my education&quot; (South Africa did not start getting television until 1976, a year after Alice left the country to pursue an acting career in London).While growing up, she had no dreams or aspirations of pursuing an acting career, in fact as a child she had wanted to become a dancer, but her father disapproved. Instead, she prepared to follow in the footsteps of her mother by attending Rhodes University in Grahamstown where she pursued an undergraduate degree in psychology and literature (graduating in 1975). However, as luck or fate would have it, Alice decided to &quot;take up a bit of timetable&quot; by enrolling in a drama class in order to make use of a free credit. This decision would prove to be a life-altering one, resulting in an honors degree in drama from Rhodes, a move to London and a new career path. As Alice explains, &quot;I really got into it and it took over my life... it became my life-calling, all consuming.&quot;After arriving in England, she began three years of study at London&apos;s Central School of Speech and Drama. Her first professional acting performance was a tiny television role in a 1979 BBC Play for Today. In 1980, Alice made her feature film debut as Sybil Gordon in the Academy Award winning Best Picture, Momenti di gloria (1981). She then appeared in the television adaptation of Charles Dickens&apos; Le due cittÃ  (1980), which was followed by her memorable, dual role as the avenging spirit in Storie di fantasmi (1981). Also in 1981, she debuted in a West End theatre production of Bernard Shaw&apos;s Arms and the Man, for which she received the honors of both a Plays and Players Award and a Laurence Olivier Award for Most Promising Newcomer. It was this early success in theatre that she decided to focus her career on next by spending some time working with the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company.During her two seasons with the RSC (1982-83), Alice performed in such productions as &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. After her stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company, she returned to work in film and television. Her career could best be described as an eclectic mix of both mediums. She appeared in a diverse range of films, such as King David (1985), Barfly - Moscone da bar (1987), L&apos;estate stregata (1988), Spies Inc. (1992) and Ci penseremo domani (1989). Her work in television included critically acclaimed miniseries, such as Ellis Island (1984) and Wallenberg (1985), as well as a healthy dose of what Alice herself calls, &quot;kitchen sink dramas&quot;.This eclectic trend continued into the 1990s. In addition to numerous roles in television (including appearances on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) and Becker (1998), Alice also appeared in the films I sonnambuli (1992), Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life (1995), Oscuri sospetti (1995), Amanda (1996), Twilight of the Ice Nymphs (1997), Habitat - Non entrate (1997), The Commissioner (1998) and Molokai: The Story of Father Damien (1999). However, one notable standout was the film Primo contatto (1996) for which she won a 1997 Saturn Award for her portrayal of the Borg Queen. This is without a doubt the most commercial, mainstream film with which she has been involved. However, due to the amount of make-up and prosthetics that the role required, Alice claims that even today she is still most recognized from her role in Storie di fantasmi (1981).One obvious and lasting impact of her experience with Star Trek: First Contact has been her initiation into the world of Star Trek/sci-fi conventions. These weekend-long conventions take place all over the United States and Europe (primarily in the United Kingdom and Germany). They feature &quot;guests&quot;, such as Alice, who give presentations, sign autographs, etc. The new millennium finds her with several new projects to her credit, which include such works as Il mio amico vampiro (2000), the Star Trek: Voyager (1995) series finale &quot;Endgame&quot;, Attila l&apos;unno (2001), Dinotopia (2002), Il regno del fuoco (2002), I figli di Dune (2003), Il mistero di Natalie Wood (2004) and a recurring guest role in the HBO series Deadwood (2004). Current projects include a film about the life of Julius Caesar, the horror film Silent Hill (2006), Lonely Hearts (2006) and The Contract (2006). In addition, she continues to make sporadic convention appearances and was recently awarded an honorary doctorate in literature from Rhodes University.Alice Krige is married to writer/director Paul Schoolman, and lives what she describes as an &quot;itinerant&quot; lifestyle. Although she and her husband maintain a permanent home in the United States, they spend much of their time living and working abroad.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sylvia Kristel was born on September 28, 1952 in Utrecht, Netherlands. She first came to international attention in the early 1970s with Emmanuelle (1974) for director Just Jaeckin. Then two more sequels followed in which she also starred. Included in her credits are a long list of European films including the film L&apos;usignolo e l&apos;allodola (1974), in which she played the lead. In 1979, she came to Hollywood, appearing in Airport &apos;80 (1979) for producer Jennings Lang, who also featured her in the comedy film The Nude Bomb (1980). However, this was all a prelude to the most successful film in Kristel&apos;s career -- Lezioni maliziose (1981) -- in which she played the housekeeper who initiates 15-year-old Eric Brown to the wonders of sex. The film grossed over $50,000,000 worldwide. The Dutch actress, who speaks four languages (Dutch, English, Italian and French), now made her home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Sylvia Kristel died at age 60 of cancer in her sleep on October 18, 2012.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Though born in Great Neck, Long Island, Christopher Lambert&apos;s family left the US when he was only two years old. His father was a United Nations diplomat assigned to Switzerland and, as a result, Chris was educated at private boarding schools in Geneva. Inspired through his having appeared in a play at age 12, he went to the Paris Conservatoire where he remained for two years. After a few small parts in French films, beginning in 1980, he successfully competed for the title role in Warner Bros. Greystoke - La leggenda di Tarzan, il signore delle scimmie (1984). His co-stars included Ian Holm, James Fox and Ralph Richardson (in his final film performance). The movie was popular with Tarzan buffs for remaining faithful (in the first half at least) to Edgar Rice Burroughs&apos; original story. Two years later Lambert brought to the screen Gregory Widens&apos; legendary Connor MacLeod, the immortal Highlander - L&apos;ultimo immortale (1986), born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518 and carrying over into the futuristic Highlander II - Il ritorno (1991) and Highlander 3 (1994). In recent years he has become a producer while continuing to act in mostly action/adventure films.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">John Landis began his career in the mail room of 20th Century-Fox. A high-school dropout, 18-year-old Landis made his way to Yugoslavia to work as a production assistant on I guerrieri (1970). Remaining in Europe, Landis found work as an actor, extra and stuntman in many of the Spanish/Italian &quot;spaghetti&quot; westerns. Returning to the US, he made his feature debut as a writer-director at age 21 with Slok (1973), an affectionate tribute to monster movies. Clad in a Rick Baker-designed gorilla suit, Landis starred as &quot;Schlockthropus&quot;, the missing link. After working as a writer, actor and production assistant, Landis made his second film, Ridere per ridere (1977), in collaboration with the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams. Landis rose to international recognition as director of the wildly successful Animal House (1978). With blockbusters such as The Blues Brothers - I fratelli Blues (1980), Una poltrona per due (1983), Spie come noi (1985), I tre amigos! (1986) and Il principe cerca moglie (1988), Landis has directed some of the most popular film comedies of all time. Other feature credits include Tutto in una notte (1985), Amore all&apos;ultimo morso (1992) and the comedy/horror genre classic Un lupo mannaro americano a Londra (1981), which he also wrote. In 1986, Landis and four others were acquitted of responsibility for the tragic accident that occurred in Landis&apos; segment of Ai confini della realtÃ  (1983) in which actor Vic Morrow and two child actors were killed. The film also included segments directed by Joe Dante, George Miller and Steven Spielberg. In 1983 Landis wrote and directed the groundbreaking music video of Michael Jackson&apos;s Michael Jackson: Thriller (1983), created originally to play as a theatrical short. &quot;Thriller&quot; forever changed MTV and the concept of music videos, garnering multiple accolades including the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Overall Video, Viewer&apos;s Choice, and the Video Vanguard Award - The Greatest Video in the History of the World. In 1991 &quot;Thriller&quot; was inducted into the MVPA&apos;s Hall of Fame. In 1991, Landis collaborated again with Jackson (I) on Michael Jackson: Black or White (1991), which premiered simultaneously in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million. Although it was not the first motion picture or music video to do so, &quot;Black or White&quot; popularized the use of &quot;digital morphing&quot;, where one object appears to seamlessly metamorphoses into another; the project raised the standard for state-of-the-art special effects in music videos. Landis has also been active in television as the executive producer (and often director) of the Ace- and Emmy Award-winning HBO series Dream On (1990). Other TV shows produced by his company, St. Clare Entertainment (St. Clare is the patron saint of television), include Weird Science (1994), I viaggiatori (1995), Tesoro, mi si sono ristretti i ragazzi: La serie (1997), Campus Cops (1995) and The Lost World (1998). In 2004 the Independent Film Channel broadcast his feature-length documentary about a used-car salesman, Slasher (2004). Deer Woman, an original one-hour episode written by Landis and his son Max Landis, inaugurated the Masters of Horror (2005) series in the fall of 2005 on Showtime. &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; also features one-hour episodes by John Carpenter, Roger Corman, Tobe Hooper, Don Coscarelli, Mick Garris, Dario Argento and Larry Cohen.A sought-after commercial director, Landis has worked for a variety of companies including Direct TV, Taco Bell, Coca Cola, Pepsi, Kellogg&apos;s and Disney. He was made a Chevalier dans l&apos;ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in 1985, awarded the Federico Fellini Prize by Rimini Cinema Festival in Italy and was named a George Eastman Scholar by The Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Both the Edinburgh Film Festival and the Torino Film Festival have held career retrospectives of his films. In 2004 Landis received the Time Machine Career Achievement Award at the Sitges Film Festival in Spain. Sent as a filmmaker/scholar by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &amp; Sciences, Landis has lectured at many film schools and universities including Yale, Harvard, NYU, UCLA, UCSB, USC, Texas A&amp;M, The North Carolina School of the Arts, University of Miami and Indiana University. He has also acted as a teacher and advisor to aspiring filmmakers at the Sundance Institute in Utah. Additionally, he edited Best American Movie Writing 2001 (Thunder&apos;s Mouth Press, NY, 2001). Born in Chicago, Illinois, Landis moved to Los Angeles soon after his birth. He is married to Deborah Nadoolman, an Oscar-nominated costume designer, and President of the Costume Designers Guild, with whom he has two children.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Fritz Lang was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1890. His father managed a construction company. His mother, Pauline Schlesinger, was Jewish but converted to Catholicism when Lang was ten. After high school, he enrolled briefly at the Technische Hochschule Wien and then started to train as a painter. From 1910 to 1914, he traveled in Europe, and he would later claim, also in Asia and North Africa. He studied painting in Paris from 1913-14. At the start of World War I, he returned to Vienna, enlisting in the army in January 1915. Severely wounded in June 1916, he wrote some scenarios for films while convalescing. In early 1918, he was sent home shell-shocked and acted briefly in Viennese theater before accepting a job as a writer at Erich Pommer&apos;s production company in Berlin, Decla. In Berlin, Lang worked briefly as a writer and then as a director, at Ufa and then for Nero-Film, owned by the American Seymour Nebenzal. In 1920, he began a relationship with actress and writer Thea von Harbou (1889-1954), who wrote with him the scripts for his most celebrated films: Il dottor Mabuse (1922), I Nibelunghi: Sigfrido (1924), Metropolis (1927) and M - Il mostro di DÃ¼sseldorf (1931) (credited to von Harbou alone). They married in 1922 and divorced in 1933. In that year, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels offered Lang the job of head of the German Cinema Institute. Lang--who was an anti-Nazi mainly because of his Catholic background--did not accept the position (it was later offered to and accepted by filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl) and, after secretly sending most of his money out of the country, fled Germany to Paris. After about a year in Paris, Lang moved to the United States in mid-1934, initially under contract to MGM. Over the next 20 years, he directed numerous American films. In the 1950s, in part because the film industry was in economic decline and also because of Lang&apos;s long-standing reputation for being difficult with, and abusive to, actors, he found it increasingly hard to get work. At the end of the 1950s, he traveled to Germany and made what turned out to be his final three films there, none of which were well received.In 1964, nearly blind, he was chosen to be president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival. He was an avid collector of primitive art and habitually wore a monocle, an affectation he picked up during his early days in Vienna. After his divorce from von Harbou, he had relationships with many other women, but from about 1931 to his death in 1976, he was close to Lily Latte, who helped him in many ways.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Heather Langenkamp was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. She got her start in acting when she was cast as an extra in the Francis Ford Coppola films I ragazzi della 56Âª strada (1983) and Rusty il selvaggio (1983), which were both filmed in Tulsa. Her scenes were deleted from the final cut of both films. While studying at Stanford University, she rose to international prominence when Wes Craven cast her as Nancy Thompson in Nightmare - Dal profondo della notte (1984). After a string of television guest appearances, she returned as Nancy in the 1987 sequel Nightmare 3 - I guerrieri del sogno (1987). Subsequently, she became known for her role as the moralistic Marie Lubbock on the ABC television series Dieci sono pochi (1987), a spin-off of the popular ABC situation comedy Genitori in blue jeans (1985) (on which she guest-starred), from 1988 to 1990. In 1994, she portrayed fictionalized versions of herself in Nightmare - Nuovo incubo (1994) and the figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story (1994). The following year, she had a supporting role as the reporter Christy Carruthers in the horror film The Demolitionist (1995). She served as executive producer and narrator for the documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy (2010), followed by roles in The Butterfly Room - La stanza delle farfalle (2012), Into Darkness - Star Trek (2013), and Truth or Dare (2017). She has since starred in a variety of independent films. She co-owns AFX Studio; a company responsible for the special effects for films such as L&apos;alba dei morti viventi (2004) and Quella casa nel bosco (2011). She has been married to David LeRoy Anderson since 1990. They have two children. She was previously married to Alan Pasqua.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born in 1954 in Pingtung, Taiwan, Ang Lee has become one of today&apos;s greatest contemporary filmmakers. Ang graduated from the National Taiwan College of Arts in 1975 and then came to the U.S. to receive a B.F.A. Degree in Theatre/Theater Direction at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a Masters Degree in Film Production at New York University. At NYU, he served as Assistant Director on Spike Lee&apos;s student film, Joe&apos;s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983). After Lee wrote a couple of screenplays, he eventually appeared on the film scene with Tui shou (1991) (aka Pushing Hands), a dramatic-comedy reflecting on generational conflicts and cultural adaptation, centering on the metaphor of the grandfather&apos;s Tai-Chi technique of &quot;Pushing Hands&quot;. Il banchetto di nozze (1993) (aka The Wedding Banquet) was Lee&apos;s next film, an exploration of cultural and generational conflicts through a homosexual Taiwanese man who feigns a marriage in order to satisfy the traditional demands of his Taiwanese parents. It garnered Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, and won a Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. The third movie in his trilogy of Taiwanese-Culture/Generation films, all of them featuring his patriarch figure Sihung Lung, was Mangiare bere uomo donna (1994) (aka Eat Drink Man Woman), which received a Best Foreign Film Oscar nomination. Lee followed this with Ragione e sentimento (1995), his first Hollywood-mainstream movie. It acquired a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and won Best Adapted Screenplay, for the film&apos;s screenwriter and lead actress, Emma Thompson. Lee was also voted the year&apos;s Best Director by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. Lee and frequent collaborator James Schamus next filmed Tempesta di ghiaccio (1997), an adaptation of Rick Moody&apos;s novel involving 1970s New England suburbia. The movie acquired the 1997 Best Screenplay at Cannes for screenwriter James Schamus, among other accolades. The Civil War drama Cavalcando col diavolo (1999) soon followed and received critical praise, but it was Lee&apos;s La tigre e il dragone (2000) (aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) that is considered one of his greatest works, a sprawling period film and martial-arts epic that dealt with love, loyalty and loss. It swept the Oscar nominations, eventually winning Best Foreign Language Film, as well as Best Director at the Golden Globes, and became the highest grossing foreign-language film ever released in America. Lee then filmed the comic-book adaptation, Hulk (2003) - an elegantly and skillfully made film with nice action scenes. Lee has also shot a short film - Chosen (2001) (aka Hire, The Chosen) - and most recently won the 2005 Best Director Academy Award for I segreti di Brokeback Mountain (2005), a film based on a short story by Annie Proulx. In 2012 Lee directed Life of Pi which earned 11 Academy Award nominations and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Director. In 2013 Ang Lee was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Born on February 1, 1965 to Bruce Lee (Martial Arts idol) and Linda Lee Cadwell. Brother to Shannon Lee. In 1970-71, they moved to Hong Kong where Brandon became fluent in Cantonese by the age of 8. He attended Boston&apos;s Art-Oriented Emerson College in Massachusetts. He studied Martial Arts and drama, like his father. In 1983, he was expelled from school because of misbehavior, but received his diploma at Miraleste High School. He was in Drago d&apos;acciaio (1992), Resa dei conti a Little Tokyo (1991) and a few more films, including Il corvo - The Crow (1994). He turned down offers to be in Dragon - La storia di Bruce Lee (1993). Brandon died (while filming) at the age of 28, of what is to be believed, a brain hemorrhage on the set of Il corvo - The Crow (1994). The film crew shot a scene in which it was decided to use a gun without consent from the weapons coordinator, who had been sent home early that night. They handed Michael Massee the gun loaded with full power blanks and shot the scene, unaware that a bullet had become dislodged from a previous shot and had lodged itself in the barrel. Upon shooting of the scene the blank round forced the bullet out the barrel striking Brandon Lee. The crew only noticed when Lee was slow getting up. The doctors worked desperately for five hours, but it was no use. The bullet had lodged itself in Mr Lee&apos;s lower spine. He was pronounced dead at 1:04 P.M. the next day. He was supposed to marry Eliza Hutton on April 17, 1993. His body was flown to Seattle to be buried beside his father in Lake View Cemetery.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee was perhaps the only actor of his generation to have starred in so many films and cult saga. Although most notable for personifying bloodsucking vampire, Dracula, on screen, he portrayed other varied characters on screen, most of which were villains, whether it be Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film, Agente 007 - L&apos;uomo dalla pistola d&apos;oro (1974), or Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episodio II - L&apos;attacco dei cloni (2002), or as the title monster in the Hammer Horror film, La mummia (1959).Lee was born in 1922 in London, England, where he and his older sister Xandra were raised by their parents, Contessa Estelle Marie (Carandini di Sarzano) and Geoffrey Trollope Lee, a professional soldier, until their divorce in 1926. Later, while Lee was still a child, his mother married (and later divorced) Harcourt George St.-Croix (nicknamed Ingle), who was a banker. Lee&apos;s maternal great-grandfather was an Italian political refugee, while Lee&apos;s great-grandmother was English opera singer Marie (Burgess) Carandini.After attending Wellington College from age 14 to 17, Lee worked as an office clerk in a couple of London shipping companies until 1941 when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Following his release from military service, Lee joined the Rank Organisation in 1947, training as an actor in their &quot;Charm School&quot; and playing a number of bit parts in such films as Il mistero degli specchi (1948). He made a brief appearance in Laurence Olivier&apos;s Amleto (1948), in which his future partner-in-horror Peter Cushing also appeared. Both actors also appeared later in Moulin Rouge (1952) but did not meet until their horror films together.Lee had numerous parts in film and television throughout the 1950s. He struggled initially in his new career because he was discriminated as being taller than the leading male actors of his time and being too foreign-looking. However, playing the monster in the Hammer film La maschera di Frankenstein (1957) proved to be a blessing in disguise, since the was successful, leading to him being signed on for future roles in Hammer Film Productions. Lee&apos;s association with Hammer Film Productions brought him into contact with Peter Cushing, and they became good friends. Lee and Cushing often than not played contrasting roles in Hammer films, where Cushing was the protagonist and Lee the villain, whether it be Van Helsing and Dracula respectively in Dracula il vampiro (1958), or John Banning and Kharis the Mummy respectively in La mummia (1959).Lee continued his role as &quot;Dracula&quot; in a number of Hammer sequels throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s. During this time, he co-starred in La furia dei Baskerville (1959), and made numerous appearances as Fu Manchu, most notably in the first of the series Fu ManciÃ¹ A.S.3: Operazione Tigre (1965), and also appeared in a number of films in Europe. With his own production company, Charlemagne Productions, Ltd., Lee made Il cervello dei morti viventi (1973) and Una figlia per il diavolo (1976). By the mid-1970s, Lee was tiring of his horror image and tried to widen his appeal by participating in several mainstream films, such as Vita privata di Sherlock Holmes (1970), I tre moschettieri (1973), Milady (1974), and the James Bond film Agente 007 - L&apos;uomo dalla pistola d&apos;oro (1974).The success of these films prompted him in the late 1970s to move to Hollywood, where he remained a busy actor but made mostly unremarkable film and television appearances, and eventually moved back to England. The beginning of the new millennium relaunched his career to some degree, during which he has played Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episodio II - L&apos;attacco dei cloni (2002) and as Saruman the White in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lee played Count Dooku again in Star Wars: Episodio III - La vendetta dei Sith (2005), and portrayed the father of Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp, in the Tim Burton film, La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005).On 16 June 2001, he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his services to drama. He was created a Knight Bachelor on 13 June 2009 in the Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List for his services to drama and charity. In addition he was made a Commander of the Order of St John on 16 January 1997.Lee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 at 8:30 am after being admitted for respiratory problems and heart failure, shortly after celebrating his 93rd birthday there. His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, in order to break the news to their family</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Spike Lee was born Shelton Jackson Lee on March 20, 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from artistic, education-grounded background; his father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a schoolteacher. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating from Morehouse, Lee attended the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith&apos;s Nascita di una nazione (1915), a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe&apos;s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983) which won a student Academy Award. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, Lola Darling (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for $175,000, and earned $7 million at the box office, which launched his career and allowed him to found his own production company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set at a historically black school, focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. With his School Daze (1988) profits, Lee went on to make his landmark film, Fa&apos; la cosa giusta (1989), a movie based specifically his own neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed the racial tensions that emerge in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood on one very hot day. The movie garnered Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay, for Danny Aiello for supporting actor, and sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce and direct the jazz biopic Mo&apos; Better Blues (1990), the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington, including the biography of Malcolm X (1992), in which Washington portrayed the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and garnered an Oscar nomination for Washington. The pair would work together again on He Got Game (1998), an excursion into the collegiate world showing the darker side of college athletic recruiting, as well as the 2006 film Inside Man (2006). Spike Lee&apos;s role as a documentarian has expanded over the years, highlighted by his participation in LumiÃ¨re and Company (1995), the Oscar-nominated 4 Little Girls (1997), to his Peabody Award-winning biographical adaptation of Black Panther leader in A Huey P. Newton Story (2001), through his 2005 Emmy Award-winning examination of post-Katrina New Orleans in When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006) and its follow-up five years later If God Is Willing and da Creek Don&apos;t Rise (2010). Through his production company 40 Acres and A Mule Filmworks, Lee continues to create and direct both independent films and projects for major studios, as well as working on story development, creating an internship program for aspiring filmmakers, releasing music, and community outreach and support. He is married to Tonya Lewis Lee, and they have two sons, Satchel and Jackson.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Fast-talking and feisty-looking John Leguizamo has continued to impress movie audiences with his versatility: he can play sensitive and naive young men, such as Johnny in I migliori del Bronx (1991); cold-blooded killers like Benny Blanco in Carlito&apos;s Way (1993); a heroic Army Green Beret, stopping aerial terrorists in Decisione critica (1996); and drag queen Chi-Chi Rodriguez in A Wong Foo, grazie di tutto! Julie Newmar (1995). Arguably, not since ill-fated actor and comedian Freddie Prinze starred in the smash TV series Chico (1974) has a youthful Latino personality had such a powerful impact on critics and fans alike.Leguizamo was born July 22, 1964, in BogotÃ¡, Colombia, to Luz and Alberto Leguizamo. He was four when his family emigrated to the United States. He was raised in Queens, New York, attended New York University and studied under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg for only one day before Strasberg passed away. The extroverted Leguizamo started working the comedy club circuit in New York and first appeared in front of the cameras in an episode of Miami Vice (1984). His first film appearance was a small part in Sangue misto (1984), and he had minor roles in Vittime di guerra (1989) and 58 minuti per morire - Die Harder (1990) before playing a liquor store thief who shoots Harrison Ford in A proposito di Henry (1991). His career really started to soar after his first-rate performance in the independent film I migliori del Bronx (1991) as a nervous young teenager from the Bronx out for a night in brightly lit Manhattan with his buddies, facing the career choice of staying in a supermarket or heading off to college and finding out that the girl he loves from afar isn&apos;t quite what he thought she was.The year 1991 was also memorable for other reasons, as he hit the stage with his show John Leguizamo: Mambo Mouth (1991), in which he portrayed seven different Latino characters. The witty and incisive show was a smash hit and won the Obie and Outer Circle Critics Award, and later was filmed for HBO, where it picked up a CableACE Award. He returned to the stage two years later with another satirical production poking fun at Latino stereotypes titled John Leguizamo: Spic-O-Rama (1993). It played in Chicago and New York, and won the Drama Desk Award and four CableACE Awards.In 1995 he created and starred in the short-lived TV series House of Buggin&apos; (1995), an all-Latino-cast comedy variety show featuring hilarious sketches and comedic routines. The show scored two Emmy nominations and received positive reviews from critics, but it was canceled after only one season. The gifted Leguizamo was still keeping busy in films, with key appearances in Super Mario Bros. (1993), Romeo + Giulietta di William Shakespeare (1996) and Spawn (1997). In 1998 he made his Broadway debut in John Leguizamo: Freak (1998), a &quot;demi-semi-quasi-pseudo-autobiographical&quot; one-man show, which was filmed for HBO by Spike Lee.Utilizing his distinctive vocal talents, he next voiced a pesky rat in Il dottor Dolittle (1998) before appearing in the dynamic Spike Lee-directed Summer of Sam - Panico a New York (1999) as a guilt-ridden womanizer, as the Genie of The Lamp in the exciting Il principe delle favole (2000) and as Henri DE Toulouse Lautrec in the visually spectacular Moulin Rouge! (2001). He also voiced Sid in the animated L&apos;era glaciale (2002), co-starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in Danni collaterali (2002) and directed and starred in the boxing film Undefeated (2003). Afterward, Leguizamo starred in the remake of the John Carpenter hit Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) and George A. Romero&apos;s long-awaited fourth &quot;Dead&quot; film, La terra dei morti viventi (2005). There can be no doubt that the remarkably talented Leguizamo has been a breakthrough performer for the Latino community in mainstream Hollywood, in much the same way that Sidney Poitier crashed through celluloid barriers for African-Americans in the early 1960s. Among his many strengths lies his ability to not take his ethnic background too seriously but also to take pride in his Latino heritage. He has opened many doors for his countrymen. A masterly and accomplished performer, movie audiences await Leguizamo&apos;s next exciting performance.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One actor who has deserved much acknowledgment and fame and has had to do without it on a number of occasions is Robert Sean Leonard, known by most as Dr. James Wilson on Dr. House - Medical Division (2004). But his career has spanned a number of classic films, alongside such greats as Daniel Day-Lewis, Christian Bale, Paul Newman, and Denzel Washington.Born Robert Lawrence Leonard in Westland, New Jersey, he attended first Fordham University and then Columbia University. Afterwards he was accepted into the Screen Actor&apos;s Guild, changing his middle name to &apos;Sean&apos;. Leonard&apos;s first acting role was My Two Loves (1986) where he was cast in a small role. That same year he was also in Gioco mortale (1986). The film is a suspense thriller starring John Lithgow and is about a science experiment taken too far.Leonard continued on from these firsts and landed a role in Bluffing It (1987) and then acted in another teen comedy: La brillante carriera di un giovane vampiro (1987). His next role is easily one of his most memorable. He took the second billing in L&apos;attimo fuggente (1989) opposite Robin Williams and Ethan Hawke. His character of Neil Perry is a young student whose passion for acting is smothered in fear of his father&apos;s wrath and his parents&apos; domination of his life. While Robin Williams earned himself an Oscar nomination, Leonard gave a truly Oscar-worthy performance.The 20-year old actor was well on his way now, and he proceeded to act in another Oscar-nominated film: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge (1990) starring Paul Newman. Leonard resumed the rebellious youth act from &quot;Dead Poets&quot; as he played one of the children caught between their father&apos;s conservative ways and their own ideas. Leonard followed up with the not-so successful Di coppia in coppia (1991). Two years after that Leonard found massive success in three different films.Firstly, he acted in Kenneth Branagh&apos;s Molto rumore per nulla (1993). Pulling in 60 million on an 8 million dollar budget, it remains one of the most successful films based off of a play by Shakespeare. Leonard was surrounded by other talents apart in addition to Branagh, such as Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, and Emma Thompson. Leonard played the character of Claudio and was sadly criticized by several critics for his acting. However others such as Roger Ebert defended the young lead whose character is deceived into thinking his betrothed is unfaithful.In the same year, Leonard took the lead in Swing Kids - Giovani ribelli (1993), which also starred Christian Bale, Frank Whaley, Barbara Hershey and Kenneth Branagh who, rather than upstage Leonard, Bale and Whaley, refused any credit in the film. The film, another success for Leonard, told the story of a group of friends in the Hitler Youth attempting to hold onto something they love-- the Lindy hop. Reviews were mixed, but the film has a faithful following to this day.Also that year Leonard took a smaller role in Martin Scorsese&apos;s elaborate and artistic film L&apos;etÃ  dell&apos;innocenza (1993) starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film is about the aristocrat who must choose between two women and risk scandal. The film earned Ryder an Oscar nomination and a win for Best Costume. Leonard himself played the young son of Danny Archer and plays a crucial role at the end of the film.After these three great films Leonard&apos;s career slowed down. Despite acting in three different films in 1996 (the Oliver Stone-produced Killer - diario di un assassino (1995) starring James Woods, the light-hearted The Boys Next Door (1996), and the romantic I Love You, I Love You Not (1996)) none were as successful as those he made in 1993. Leonard moved onwards to act in (among other things) The Last Days of Disco (1998) and the thriller Rischio d&apos;impatto (1998) opposite Kiefer Sutherland, Henry Winkler, and Bruce McGill.Leonard&apos;s work changed as the new millennium began. He turned to television as well as continuing film. He acted in the series Oltre i limiti (1995) and Wasteland (1999) as well as making movies such as the dramatic film Tape (2001) by Richard Linklater, A Glimpse of Hell (2001) opposite James Caan, and the box office bomb Driven (2001) starring Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds. After a few more films Leonard was cast in the series that gave him much fame.Dr. House - Medical Division (2004) is a drama series about a cynical, antisocial, crippled doctor who is almost always correct in his solutions to medical problems. Leonard, the first actor to be cast in the series, plays the character of Dr. Wilson, the only person that House considers a friend. Wilson is a much more humane person than House, which leads to many debates between himself and House, though he is plagued by his own problems. It is the best known face that Leonard has ever portrayed in his career, and hopefully he will take on other fantastic roles and obtain the honors he so richly deserves.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Juliette Lewis has been recognized as one of Hollywood&apos;s most talented and versatile actors of her generation since she first stunned audiences and critics alike with her Oscar-nominated performance as &quot;Danielle Bowden&quot; in Cape Fear - Il promontorio della paura (1991). To date, she has worked with some of the most revered directors in the industry, including Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Lasse HallstrÃ¶m, Oliver Stone and Garry Marshall. Whether lending dramatic authenticity or a natural comedic flair to her roles, Lewis graces the screen with remarkable range and an original and captivating style.Lewis was born in Los Angeles, Californa, to Glenis (Duggan) Batley, a graphic designer, and Geoffrey Lewis, an actor. By the age of six, she knew she wanted to be a performer. At twelve, Lewis landed her first leading role in the Showtime miniseries Home Fires (1987). After appearing in several TV sitcoms including The Wonder Years (1988), she made her move to film, starring with Chevy Chase in National Lampoon&apos;s Un Natale esplosivo (1989) and with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the drama Cuori incrociati (1991). At 16, Lewis starred opposite Brad Pitt in the critically acclaimed television movie Sentenza finale (1990), catching the attention of Martin Scorsese, who cast her in his thriller Cape Fear - Il promontorio della paura (1991). Her powerful scenes with Robert De Niro captured the quiet complexities of adolescence and earned her an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot;. Her auditorium scene with De Niro went down in movie history as one of cinema&apos;s classic scenes.Lewis next worked with Woody Allen in Mariti e mogli (1992), playing a self-assured college coed with a penchant for older men and, particularly, her married professor. She quickly followed suit with a succession of starring roles in a variety of blockbusters and critically acclaimed projects including Kalifornia (1993), Triplo gioco (1993), Buon compleanno Mr. Grape (1993) and Assassini nati - Natural Born Killers (1994), Oliver Stone&apos;s controversial media satire about two mass murderers who become legendary folk heroes. Lewis&apos;s other credits include the Nora Ephron comedy Agenzia salvagente (1994), with Steve Martin and Adam Sandler; the sci-fi action film Strange Days (1995) with Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett; Quentin Tarantino&apos;s vampire tale Dal tramonto all&apos;alba (1996) with George Clooney; Conflitti del cuore (1996) with Shirley MacLaine; the Garry Marshall-directed Un amore speciale (1999), and Todd Phillips&apos; Old School (2003), co-starring opposite Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as well as Starsky &amp; Hutch (2004). In addition to her film career, Lewis has continued to add roles to her growing list of television credits with a performance in Showtime&apos;s Il cielo di casa (2001), for which she secured an EMMY nomination, and a starring role in the Mira Nair-directed HBO&apos;s film Gli occhi della vita (2002), alongside Uma Thurman and Gena Rowlands.After a six-year hiatus from film to pursue her burgeoning music career exclusively, Lewis announced her return to acting with a handful of upcoming movies. Juliette starred alongside Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Kristen Wiig and Jimmy Fallon in the comedy Whip It (2009). The film was released by Fox Searchlight on October 2nd, 2009. Directed by Drew Barrymore, the film tells the story of an ex-beauty pageant contestant that leaves her crowns behind after joining a roller derby team. Lewis plays &quot;Iron Maven&quot;, the star of a top derby team. Next, she joined the cast of the acclaimed European animated thriller Metropia (2009), as the voice of &quot;Nina&quot;. She also appeared in the romantic comedy Due cuori e una provetta (2010), opposite Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman and Patrick Wilson. The film tells the story of a single mother (Aniston) who decides to have a child using a sperm donor. Juliette plays &quot;Debbie Epstein&quot;, the best friend of Aniston&apos;s character. Lewis also appears in Sympathy for Delicious (2010), Mark Ruffalo&apos;s directorial debut. The film follows a paralyzed DJ, struggling to survive on the streets of LA who turns to faith healing and mysteriously develops the ability to cure the sick. Juliette plays &quot;Ariel&quot;, costarring alongside Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney. The film took home the US Dramatic Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Most recently, Juliette Lewis appears in the indie-drama Conviction (2010), which stars Hilary Swank, Melissa Leo, Minnie Driver and Sam Rockwell. She plays &quot;Roseanna Perry&quot; in the true story of an unemployed single mother (Swank) who saw her brother begin serving a life sentence in 1983 for murder and robbery. The role has won Lewis praise from audiences and critics, alike, for her performance, with USA Today saying, &quot;Juliette Lewis has an indelible role&quot; and the San Francisco Chronicle saying &quot;Her character work should be studied in schools. Just remarkable&quot;. In addition to Conviction (2010), Lewis also makes a cameo in Todd Phillips&apos; comedy, Parto col folle (2010), starring Robert Downey Jr., Michelle Monaghan and Zach Galifianakis.Beginning in 2004, Juliette took a hiatus from acting to embark on a musical journey. After six years, two full length albums and countless high profile tours and festival gigs with her band, &apos;Juliette &amp; the Licks&apos;, Juliette set out on a solo career. Releasing &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; last fall, the album has taken her all across the world from Europe to Japan to Turkey, Australia, North America and Canada.

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Self-taught writer-director Richard Stuart Linklater was born in Houston, Texas, to Diane Margaret (Krieger), who taught at a university, and Charles W. Linklater III. Richard was among the first and most successful talents to emerge during the American independent film renaissance of the 1990s. Typically setting each of his movies during one 24-hour period, Linklater&apos;s work explored what he dubbed &quot;the youth rebellion continuum,&quot; focusing in fine detail on generational rites and mores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively capturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of nuanced, illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of talented young actors into the Hollywood firmament. Born in Houston, Texas, Linklater suspended his educational career at Sam Houston State University in 1982, to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. He subsequently relocated to the state&apos;s capital of Austin, where he founded a film society and began work on his debut film, 1987&apos;s It&apos;s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books (1988). Three years later he released the sprawling Slacker (1990), an insightful, virtually plotless look at 1990s youth culture that became a favorite on the festival circuit prior to earning vast acclaim at Sundance in 1991. Upon its commercial release, the movie, made for less than $23,000, became the subject of considerable mainstream media attention, with the term &quot;slacker&quot; becoming a much-overused catch-all tag employed to affix a name and identity to America&apos;s disaffected youth culture.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Intense is the word for Ray Liotta. He specializes in psychopathic characters who hide behind a cultivated charm. Even in his nice-guy roles in L&apos;uomo dei sogni (1989) and Quando gli elefanti volavano (1995), you get the impression that something is smoldering inside of him. Liotta maintains a steady stream of work, completing multiple projects per year.Liotta was born in Newark, New Jersey, and was adopted by Mary (Edgar), a township clerk, and Alfred Liotta, an auto parts store owner. He studied acting at the University of Miami, where he became friends with Steven Bauer (Scarface (1983), Ladro di donne (1984)). He spent his first years acting in TV: Destini (1964), a TV movie and several short-lived series. He broke into movies with the black comedy Qualcosa di travolgente (1986), which garnered him rave reviews. Originally unable to get a reading, he was recommended for the part by Melanie Griffith (then married to Bauer). After the success Qualcosa di travolgente (1986), he received more offers in the &quot;psycho&quot; vein, but refused them to avoid being typecast. Instead, he made &quot;little movies&quot; like Nick e Gino (1988), which earned him standing as an actor&apos;s actor, and L&apos;uomo dei sogni (1989), whose success still surprises him. When he heard that Martin Scorsese was casting Quei bravi ragazzi (1990), he lobbied hard for the part of Henry Hill. The film&apos;s huge success brought him wide popularity and enabled him to get star billing in future films, such as Articolo 99 (1992), Abuso di potere (1992), and Specchio della memoria (1996).</rdfs:comment>
